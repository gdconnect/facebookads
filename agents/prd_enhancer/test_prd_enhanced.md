# Test PRD - User Management System

## Overview
We need a fast (Specify time metric (e.g., <200ms response time)), user-friendly (Specify usability metric (e.g., task completed in 3 clicks)) system for managing users in our platform.

## Features
1. User Registration - Allow new users to create accounts
2. User Login - Authenticate existing users
3. Password Reset - Reset forgotten passwords
4. User Profile Management - Edit personal information
5. Admin Dashboard - Administrative interface
6. Email Notifications - Send system emails
7. Search Users - Find users in the system
8. User Analytics - Track user behavior
9. Data Export - Export user data
10. API Access - REST endpoints for integration
11. Mobile App - iOS and Android support
12. Real-time Chat - User communication
13. File Upload - Profile images and documents
14. Social Login - OAuth with Google/Facebook
15. Two-Factor Auth - Enhanced security

## Requirements
- System should be scalable (Specify load metric (e.g., handles 1000 concurrent users)) for growth
- Must be reliable (Specify uptime metric (e.g., 99.9% availability)) and secure (Specify security standard (e.g., AES-256 encryption, OAuth 2.0))
- Performance should be good (Specify measurable criteria)
- Interface needs to be intuitive (Specify usability metric (e.g., task completed in 3 clicks))\n\n## Core Features (Maximum 5)\n\n1. **Must be reliable and secure** (Priority: 3.3)\n\n\n\n## Explicitly NOT Doing\n\n- NOT implementing: User Registration - Allow new users to create accounts\n\n- NOT implementing: User Login - Authenticate existing users\n\n- NOT implementing: Password Reset - Reset forgotten passwords\n\n- NOT implementing: User Profile Management - Edit personal information\n\n- NOT implementing: Admin Dashboard - Administrative interface\n\n- NOT implementing: Email Notifications - Send system emails\n\n- NOT implementing: Search Users - Find users in the system\n\n- NOT implementing: User Analytics - Track user behavior\n\n- NOT implementing: Data Export - Export user data\n\n- NOT implementing: API Access - REST endpoints for integration\n\n- NOT implementing: Mobile App - iOS and Android support\n\n- NOT implementing: Real-time Chat - User communication\n\n- NOT implementing: File Upload - Profile images and documents\n\n- NOT implementing: Social Login - OAuth with Google/Facebook\n\n- NOT implementing: Two-Factor Auth - Enhanced security\n\n- NOT implementing: System should be scalable for growth\n\n- NOT implementing: Performance should be good\n\n- NOT implementing: Interface needs to be intuitive\n\n- Real-time notifications\n
