# FoodTech Revolution

## The Challenge We Face
Restaurants struggle with food waste, losing 30% of ingredients daily due to poor inventory management and unpredictable demand patterns.

## Our Approach
An AI-powered inventory management system that predicts demand based on weather, local events, and historical patterns, reducing waste by 60%.

## Who We Serve
Independent restaurants with 20-150 seats, particularly those in urban areas with high foot traffic variability.

## Revenue Strategy
SaaS model with $99/month per location, plus premium analytics at $199/month for multi-location chains.

## How It Works
IoT sensors track ingredient usage, machine learning models predict demand, and automated ordering prevents stockouts while minimizing waste.
