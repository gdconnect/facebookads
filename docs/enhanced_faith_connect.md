## 💡 Your Original Idea

### Problem
Currently, evangelical Christians must visit multiple websites, apps, and social media platforms to access the content they desire. This fragmentation can lead to a less than optimal user experience and difficulty in discovering new and relevant content. Additionally, many existing platforms lack a community aspect, making it harder for users to engage with like-minded individuals.

### Solution
FaithConnect aims to solve these problems by offering a centralized platform that aggregates content from various sources. The platform will feature:

1. **Content Curation:**
   - A team of curators will ensure that the content is high-quality, relevant, and aligns with evangelical Christian values.
   - Users can personalize their content feed based on their interests and preferences.

2. **Diverse Content Types:**
   - Articles and blogs from trusted Christian authors and organizations.
   - Video sermons and teachings from renowned pastors and speakers.
   - Christian music and podcasts.
   - Educational materials, including Bible studies and theological resources.
   - News and updates related to the Christian community.

3. **Community Engagement:**
   - Forums and discussion boards for users to connect and share insights.
   - Social features such as groups, events, and prayer requests to foster a sense of community.

## 🎯 Refined Business Model

**Value Creation**: FaithConnect aggregates evangelical Christian content (articles, sermons, music, podcasts, Bible studies, news) into a single, personalized feed and adds community features (forums, groups, events, prayer requests). It reduces fragmentation, improves discovery, and enables engagement with like-minded believers.

**Value Capture**: Ads from Christian businesses and sponsored content; premium subscriptions for ad-free and exclusive features; optional user donations. Ads provide initial revenue; subscriptions deepen ARPU with exclusive content, advanced personalization, and community perks. Donations align with faith-driven giving behaviors.

**Unit Economics**: Early ARPU: ads $0.50–$1.50/MAU/mo if inventory sold direct; premium at $6–$10/mo with 2–5% conversion; donations $0.10–$0.30/MAU/mo. CAC via targeted social/church partnerships $2–$6 signup. Gross margin >85% if content is embedded/linked; curation/moderation are main variable costs.

**Growth Mechanism**: Church partnerships (QR codes in bulletins), pastor/influencer endorsements, SEO for curated topical pages (Bible study, sermons), email newsletters, referral rewards (invite 3 friends get premium trial), and sponsored events. Cross-post highlights to YouTube/Instagram/TikTok linking back.

**Competitive Moat**: Trust-based curation aligned to evangelical values, exclusive relationships with pastors/church networks, user interest graph for personalization, and community norms/moderation quality. Over time, creator tools and first-party data (interests, engagement) can harden defensibility, though moat is initially modest.

**Minimum Viable Scope**: A web app that aggregates 50–100 trusted RSS/YouTube/podcast sources into a personalized feed, a daily/weekly email digest, and a lightweight prayer request board. Manual curation by a small team to seed quality. Ads via direct sold sponsor slots; optional premium for ad-free.

## ❗ Critical Questions (Answer Before Proceeding)
1. What explicit permissions are needed to aggregate, embed, or excerpt content from each source without violating rights or platform terms?
2. Which user segment has the strongest pain: sermon discovery, Bible study guidance, or community/prayer—and which will drive daily retention?
3. What premium features (e.g., ad-free, exclusive studies, group tools) justify $6–$10/month and what conversion is realistic in this niche?
4. How will moderation handle theological disputes and sensitive topics while staying aligned with evangelical values and legal standards?
5. Which acquisition channel can reach sub-$4 CAC at scale: church partnerships, pastor endorsements, SEO, or paid social?
6. Which metrics will validate PMF in 90 days (e.g., D7 retention >25%, weekly sessions >3, email CTR >12%)?

## 🚨 Red Flags
- ⚠️ Content rights ambiguity can trigger takedowns or legal disputes if curation exceeds fair use.
- ⚠️ Moderation load may spike with theological disputes, politics, and sensitive prayer topics.
- ⚠️ Ad CPMs in faith media can be modest; without scale, ads may not cover curation costs.

## ✅ Quick Wins
- [ ] Launch a weekly curated email digest highlighting top 10 articles/sermons; collect interests on signup.
- [ ] Secure written aggregation/embedding permissions from 20 trusted publishers and 10 pastors.
- [ ] Sell 2 pilot newsletter/web sponsorships to Christian brands for launch month inventory.
- [ ] Create SEO-optimized topical hubs (e.g., Marriage, Apologetics, Daily Devotionals) from curated content.
- [ ] Pilot a prayer request board with clear guidelines and fast response norms to seed community.
- [ ] Enable one-click YouTube and podcast embeds with time-stamped highlights and share cards.

## 🚀 Recommended MVP (30 days)
In 30 days: a web app that ingests 50 trusted RSS/YouTube/podcast sources, tags content, serves a personalized feed and weekly email, includes a simple prayer board with moderation, and offers two fixed sponsor slots plus a $6.99/mo ad-free toggle.
