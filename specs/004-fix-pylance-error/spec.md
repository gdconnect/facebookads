# Feature Specification: Fix Pydantic V1 Validator Deprecation Warnings

**Feature Branch**: `004-fix-pylance-error`
**Created**: 2025-01-09
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "fix pylance error: The function 'validator' is deprecated
  Pydantic V1 style `@validator` validators are deprecated. You should migrate to Pydantic V2 style `@field_validator` validators, see the migration guide for more detailsPylance"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ’ If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ’ Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ’ Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ’ If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ’ Each requirement must be testable
   ’ Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ’ If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ’ If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ¡ Quick Guidelines
-  Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- L Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- =e Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a developer working with the brand identity generator codebase, I need the validation framework to use current Pydantic V2 syntax instead of deprecated V1 syntax, so that my IDE (Pylance) does not show deprecation warnings and the code follows current best practices.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** the brand identity generator code uses Pydantic V1 `@validator` decorators, **When** I open the file in an IDE with Pylance, **Then** I should see no deprecation warnings about validator syntax
2. **Given** the validation logic is migrated to V2 syntax, **When** the application runs with input validation, **Then** all validation rules should work exactly as before
3. **Given** the updated validators are in place, **When** invalid configuration is provided, **Then** the system should show the same clear error messages as before

### Edge Cases
- What happens when the V2 validators encounter the same edge cases that V1 validators handled?
- How does the system maintain backward compatibility during the migration?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST update all `@validator` decorators to `@field_validator` syntax
- **FR-002**: System MUST maintain identical validation behavior after migration
- **FR-003**: System MUST continue to show clear, helpful error messages for invalid inputs
- **FR-004**: System MUST add `@classmethod` decorator where required by Pydantic V2
- **FR-005**: System MUST update import statements to include `field_validator`
- **FR-006**: System MUST ensure all validation rules continue to work for configuration values
- **FR-007**: System MUST eliminate all Pylance deprecation warnings related to validators

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Validator Functions**: The validation methods that check configuration values like provider names, timeouts, and URLs
- **Configuration Classes**: DeveloperConfig and related models that use validation decorators
- **Error Messages**: User-facing validation error messages that must remain consistent
