# Feature Specification: Customer Journey Mapper Generator

**Feature Branch**: `008-customer-jouney-mapper`
**Created**: 2025-09-20
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "customer_jouney_mapper_generator generate a program to generate a customer journey map given a niche market, base the output on the schemas/customer_journey.json.schema"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   � Feature: Generate customer journey maps for niche markets
2. Extract key concepts from description
   � Actors: Business users, customer persona researchers
   � Actions: Generate, analyze, visualize customer journeys
   � Data: Niche market specifications, customer journey maps
   � Constraints: Must conform to customer_journey.json.schema
3. For each unclear aspect:
   � What input format for niche market specification? [could be a markdown document, json, or text, which should be first standardized to a common shape by an interim LLM call ]
   � [Should personas be generated or user-provided? - personas should be inferred from the markdown document and standardised into a json file via LLM call]
   � [What level of journey detail automation is expected? - the automation should be able to generate a complete journey map based on pareto principles and KISS]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   � Primary flow: User inputs niche market � System generates journey map
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   � Core generation capability, schema compliance, niche market input processing
6. Identify Key Entities
   � Niche Market, Customer Journey Map, Customer Persona, Journey Stage, Touchpoint
7. Run Review Checklist
   � Multiple clarifications needed for input specifications and automation level
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning with clarifications)
```

## � Quick Guidelines
-  Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- L Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- =e Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
A business analyst working with a niche market (e.g., eco-conscious millennials buying sustainable fashion) needs to create a comprehensive customer journey map to understand how their target customers discover, evaluate, and purchase products. They input their market specification and receive a detailed journey map that includes customer personas, journey stages, touchpoints, emotions, pain points, and improvement opportunities.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a valid niche market specification, **When** the user requests journey generation, **Then** the system produces a complete customer journey map conforming to the schema
2. **Given** an invalid or incomplete market specification, **When** the user attempts generation, **Then** the system provides clear error messages indicating what information is missing
3. **Given** a generated journey map, **When** the user reviews the output, **Then** all required schema fields are populated with relevant, market-specific data
4. **Given** different niche markets in the same industry, **When** generating journeys, **Then** the maps reflect distinct customer behaviors and touchpoints specific to each niche

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a niche market has unconventional customer journey patterns?
- How does the system handle markets with very long or very short customer consideration periods?
- What occurs when generating journeys for B2B vs B2C niche markets?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST accept niche market specifications as input [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: input format - structured data, natural language, form fields?]
- **FR-002**: System MUST generate customer journey maps that validate against the customer_journey.json.schema
- **FR-003**: System MUST create realistic customer personas appropriate for the specified niche market
- **FR-004**: System MUST generate journey stages covering the complete customer lifecycle from awareness to advocacy
- **FR-005**: System MUST populate touchpoints relevant to the niche market's typical customer behavior patterns
- **FR-006**: System MUST assign appropriate emotions and pain points for each touchpoint based on market characteristics
- **FR-007**: System MUST identify realistic improvement opportunities specific to the niche market
- **FR-008**: System MUST include cross-channel experience analysis when multiple channels are relevant
- **FR-009**: System MUST populate metadata fields including industry, market segment, and tags
- **FR-010**: Users MUST be able to [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: export, save, modify?] the generated journey maps
- **FR-011**: System MUST handle [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: batch processing of multiple markets or single market only?]

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Niche Market**: Market segment specification including demographics, industry, product/service type, customer characteristics
- **Customer Journey Map**: Complete journey representation conforming to schema, including all stages, touchpoints, and metrics
- **Customer Persona**: Target customer profile with demographics, goals, pain points, and motivations specific to the niche
- **Journey Stage**: Distinct phases of the customer experience (Awareness, Consideration, Decision, Purchase, etc.)
- **Touchpoint**: Individual customer interaction points with associated channels, actions, emotions, and opportunities
