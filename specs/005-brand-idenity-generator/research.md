# Research: Brand Identity Generator Documentation

## Research Questions

From the feature specification, the following areas require clarification:

1. **Target Audience Level**: Should documentation target beginner developers, experienced users, or a mixed audience?
2. **API Documentation Depth**: Should we include full technical API reference with all classes/methods or focus on user-facing functionality?

## Research Findings

### Target Audience Analysis

**Decision**: Mixed audience with layered information architecture

**Rationale**:
- The brand identity generator serves multiple user types: developers integrating the tool, end users running CLI commands, and system administrators configuring deployments
- Analysis of existing Python CLI tool documentation (click, pytest, black) shows successful patterns use progressive disclosure
- Constitutional principle of "Developer Productivity" supports easy onboarding for all skill levels

**Alternatives considered**:
- Beginner-only: Would alienate advanced users needing technical details
- Advanced-only: Would create barriers to adoption for new users
- Separate documents: Would fragment information and increase maintenance burden

**Implementation approach**:
- Quick start section for immediate usage
- Detailed configuration and CLI reference for intermediate users
- API reference and advanced integration patterns for developers

### API Documentation Scope

**Decision**: Focus on user-facing functionality with selective technical reference

**Rationale**:
- Primary use case is CLI tool usage, not library integration
- The tool is designed as single-file program (constitutional principle), not a library
- Analysis of similar tools (argparse, click documentation) shows most users need CLI reference, not internal API
- However, configuration classes and data models are user-facing and should be documented

**Alternatives considered**:
- Full API reference: Would bloat documentation with internal implementation details
- No API reference: Would prevent advanced integration and configuration understanding
- Separate API docs: Would fragment information for power users

**Implementation approach**:
- Document configuration classes and their fields (user-facing API)
- Document CLI interface completely
- Document data models for input/output formats
- Skip internal implementation classes (LLMEnhancementEngine internals, etc.)

### Documentation Structure Research

**Decision**: Single markdown file with clear navigation sections

**Rationale**:
- Constitutional requirement for self-contained design
- Analysis of successful single-file documentation (README.md patterns, CLI tool docs)
- Enables fast search and navigation without multiple file management

**Best practices identified**:
- Table of contents with anchor links
- Progressive disclosure (overview → usage → advanced)
- Code examples for all features
- Troubleshooting section for common issues
- Quick reference sections for experienced users

### Content Organization Research

**Decision**: Problem-solution organization with reference sections

**Structure**:
1. **Overview**: What it does, why use it, key features
2. **Quick Start**: Get running in 2 minutes
3. **Installation & Setup**: Requirements, configuration
4. **Usage Guide**: Step-by-step for common scenarios
5. **CLI Reference**: Complete command documentation
6. **Configuration**: All options and environment variables
7. **Features Deep Dive**: Gap analysis, LLM integration, session management
8. **Integration**: Programmatic usage patterns
9. **Troubleshooting**: Common issues and solutions
10. **Advanced Topics**: Performance tuning, customization

**Rationale**:
- Follows successful patterns from click, pytest, and black documentation
- Supports both "I need to get started" and "I need specific information" use cases
- Aligns with constitutional principles of comprehensive documentation and developer productivity

## Content Research

### Brand Identity Generator Feature Analysis

**Core Capabilities Identified**:
- Gap analysis for brand descriptions
- LLM-enhanced brand processing (OpenAI, Anthropic, local)
- Interactive enhancement workflows
- Session persistence and caching
- Configurable output management
- Multiple enhancement levels (minimal, moderate, comprehensive)

**Configuration System**:
- Top-of-file developer configuration (constitutional compliance)
- Environment variable support
- CLI argument precedence
- Validation with Pydantic V2

**CLI Interface**:
- Input file processing
- Multiple output formats
- Provider selection
- Enhancement levels
- Interactive mode
- Session save/load
- Debug modes

**Data Flow**:
- Markdown input → parsing → gap analysis → optional LLM enhancement → JSON output
- Session management for workflow persistence
- Caching for performance optimization

## Next Phase Preparation

All research questions resolved. Ready for Phase 1 design with:
- Clear target audience strategy (mixed with progressive disclosure)
- Defined API documentation scope (user-facing functionality focus)
- Established documentation structure and content organization
- Comprehensive understanding of tool capabilities and architecture
