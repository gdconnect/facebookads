# Feature Specification: Brand Identity Generator Documentation

**Feature Branch**: `005-brand-idenity-generator`
**Created**: 2025-09-19
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "brand_idenity_generator_docs i would like to create a docs/brand_indentity_generator.md that will be a well thought out developer/user documentation for brand_identity_generator.py making it easy to quickly understand the program, its objectives, usage instructions and api"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   � Request: Create comprehensive documentation for brand_identity_generator.py
2. Extract key concepts from description
   � Actors: developers, users, stakeholders
   � Actions: understand program, use tool, integrate APIs
   � Data: brand descriptions, configuration, LLM responses
   � Constraints: single markdown file, must be comprehensive yet accessible
3. For each unclear aspect:
   � Target audience level: [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: beginner vs advanced users?]
   � API documentation depth: [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: full technical API or usage examples?]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   � Primary: Developer needs to understand and use the tool
   � Secondary: User wants to process brand descriptions
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   � Must explain program objectives clearly
   � Must provide usage instructions with examples
   � Must document configuration options
   � Must include API reference if applicable
6. Identify Key Entities: Documentation file, brand identity generator program
7. Run Review Checklist
   � Spec focuses on documentation creation, not implementation
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## � Quick Guidelines
-  Focus on WHAT documentation users need and WHY
- L Avoid HOW to implement documentation tooling
- =e Written for stakeholders who need comprehensive program documentation

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a developer or user encountering the brand identity generator for the first time, I need comprehensive documentation that quickly explains what the program does, how to use it, and how to configure it, so that I can effectively utilize the tool without having to read through the source code.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a new developer encounters the project, **When** they read the documentation, **Then** they understand the program's purpose and core capabilities within 5 minutes
2. **Given** a user wants to process brand descriptions, **When** they follow the usage instructions, **Then** they can successfully run the tool with their own data
3. **Given** a developer needs to configure the tool, **When** they consult the configuration section, **Then** they can modify settings without trial and error
4. **Given** someone wants to integrate with the tool, **When** they read the API documentation, **Then** they understand all available options and data structures
5. **Given** a user encounters an error, **When** they check the troubleshooting section, **Then** they can resolve common issues independently

### Edge Cases
- What happens when documentation becomes outdated relative to code changes?
- How does documentation serve both technical and non-technical audiences?
- What level of detail is appropriate for different user types?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: Documentation MUST explain the program's core objectives and value proposition clearly
- **FR-002**: Documentation MUST provide step-by-step usage instructions with practical examples
- **FR-003**: Documentation MUST document all configuration options with descriptions and default values
- **FR-004**: Documentation MUST include complete CLI command reference with all flags and options
- **FR-005**: Documentation MUST explain the LLM integration capabilities and provider options
- **FR-006**: Documentation MUST provide examples of input/output formats and data structures
- **FR-007**: Documentation MUST include troubleshooting section for common issues
- **FR-008**: Documentation MUST explain the gap analysis and enhancement features
- **FR-009**: Documentation MUST document session management and persistence features
- **FR-010**: Documentation MUST be organized with clear sections and navigation

*Areas requiring clarification:*
- **FR-011**: Documentation MUST target [beginners and developers]
- **FR-012**: Documentation MUST include [API reference for user-facing functionality]

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Documentation File**: Comprehensive markdown file explaining the brand identity generator program
- **Brand Identity Generator**: Python program that processes brand descriptions with AI enhancement
- **Configuration System**: Developer settings that control program behavior
- **CLI Interface**: Command-line interface with various options and flags
- **LLM Integration**: AI-powered enhancement capabilities with multiple provider support
