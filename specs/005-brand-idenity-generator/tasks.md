# Tasks: Brand Identity Generator Documentation

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/005-brand-idenity-generator/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/, quickstart.md

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Load plan.md from feature directory
   → Tech stack: Markdown documentation, Python CLI tool analysis
   → Scope: Single comprehensive documentation file
2. Load design documents:
   → research.md: Mixed audience strategy, progressive disclosure approach
   → data-model.md: Documentation structure entities and content organization
   → contracts/: Documentation requirements and content quality standards
   → quickstart.md: Verification procedures and quality gates
3. Generate tasks by category:
   → Setup: Documentation preparation and tool analysis
   → Research: Content discovery and CLI analysis
   → Content: Section writing and example creation
   → Verification: Testing and quality assurance
   → Polish: Integration and final formatting
4. Apply task rules:
   → Different content sections = mark [P] for parallel research/writing
   → Same documentation file = sequential assembly
   → Verification before integration (quality-first)
5. Number tasks sequentially (T001-T020)
6. Generate dependency graph showing content flow
7. Create parallel execution examples for research phase
8. Validate: All functional requirements covered, verification procedures included
