# Implementation Plan: Brand Identity Generator Documentation

**Branch**: `005-brand-idenity-generator` | **Date**: 2025-09-19 | **Spec**: [spec.md](/var/www/html/facebookads/specs/005-brand-idenity-generator/spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/005-brand-idenity-generator/spec.md`

## Execution Flow (/plan command scope)
```
1. Load feature spec from Input path
   → If not found: ERROR "No feature spec at {path}"
2. Fill Technical Context (scan for NEEDS CLARIFICATION)
   → Detect Project Type from context (web=frontend+backend, mobile=app+api)
   → Set Structure Decision based on project type
3. Fill the Constitution Check section based on the content of the constitution document.
4. Evaluate Constitution Check section below
   → If violations exist: Document in Complexity Tracking
   → If no justification possible: ERROR "Simplify approach first"
   → Update Progress Tracking: Initial Constitution Check
5. Execute Phase 0 → research.md
   → If NEEDS CLARIFICATION remain: ERROR "Resolve unknowns"
6. Execute Phase 1 → contracts, data-model.md, quickstart.md, agent-specific template file (e.g., `CLAUDE.md` for Claude Code, `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for GitHub Copilot, `GEMINI.md` for Gemini CLI, `QWEN.md` for Qwen Code or `AGENTS.md` for opencode).
7. Re-evaluate Constitution Check section
   → If new violations: Refactor design, return to Phase 1
   → Update Progress Tracking: Post-Design Constitution Check
8. Plan Phase 2 → Describe task generation approach (DO NOT create tasks.md)
9. STOP - Ready for /tasks command
```

**IMPORTANT**: The /plan command STOPS at step 7. Phases 2-4 are executed by other commands:
- Phase 2: /tasks command creates tasks.md
- Phase 3-4: Implementation execution (manual or via tools)

## Summary
Create comprehensive documentation for the brand identity generator Python program to help developers and users quickly understand the program's objectives, usage instructions, and API. The documentation will be a single well-structured markdown file covering all aspects of the tool including configuration, CLI commands, LLM integration, and troubleshooting.

## Technical Context
**Language/Version**: Python 3.11+ (constitutional requirement with type hints)
**Primary Dependencies**: Pydantic V2, Click CLI, OpenAI/Anthropic APIs, pytest for testing
**Storage**: File-based (JSON outputs, markdown inputs, session persistence files, cache directory)
**Testing**: pytest with contract, integration, and unit test structure
**Target Platform**: Cross-platform CLI tool (Linux, macOS, Windows)
**Project Type**: single (documentation feature for existing single-file Python program)
**Performance Goals**: Fast documentation access (target: <2 seconds to find any information)
**Constraints**: Single markdown file, must be comprehensive yet accessible, serve both beginners and advanced users
**Scale/Scope**: Document 1 Python program (~800 lines), cover all features and use cases, serve multiple audience levels

## Constitution Check
*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

**Constitutional Compliance**:
✅ **Single File Programs**: Not applicable - this is documentation for existing single-file program
✅ **Best Practice Adherence**: Documentation will follow markdown best practices and clear structure
✅ **Comprehensive Documentation**: This feature IS about creating comprehensive documentation
✅ **Pydantic V2 Integration**: Not applicable - documenting existing Pydantic V2 compliant program
✅ **Self-Contained Design**: Documentation will be self-contained markdown file
✅ **Developer Productivity**: Documentation directly enhances developer onboarding and productivity
✅ **Type Safety & IDE Compliance**: Not applicable - no code changes, only documentation

**Result**: ✅ PASS - No constitutional violations identified

# Option 3: Mobile + API (when "iOS/Android" detected)
api/
└── [same as backend above]

ios/ or android/
└── [platform-specific structure]
```

**Structure Decision**: [DEFAULT to Option 1 unless Technical Context indicates web/mobile app]

## Phase 0: Outline & Research
1. **Extract unknowns from Technical Context** above:
   - For each NEEDS CLARIFICATION → research task
   - For each dependency → best practices task
   - For each integration → patterns task

2. **Generate and dispatch research agents**:
   ```
   For each unknown in Technical Context:
     Task: "Research {unknown} for {feature context}"
   For each technology choice:
     Task: "Find best practices for {tech} in {domain}"
   ```

3. **Consolidate findings** in `research.md` using format:
   - Decision: [what was chosen]
   - Rationale: [why chosen]
   - Alternatives considered: [what else evaluated]

**Output**: research.md with all NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts
*Prerequisites: research.md complete*

1. **Extract entities from feature spec** → `data-model.md`:
   - Entity name, fields, relationships
   - Validation rules from requirements
   - State transitions if applicable

2. **Generate API contracts** from functional requirements:
   - For each user action → endpoint
   - Use standard REST/GraphQL patterns
   - Output OpenAPI/GraphQL schema to `/contracts/`

3. **Generate contract tests** from contracts:
   - One test file per endpoint
   - Assert request/response schemas
   - Tests must fail (no implementation yet)

4. **Extract test scenarios** from user stories:
   - Each story → integration test scenario
   - Quickstart test = story validation steps

5. **Update agent file incrementally** (O(1) operation):
   - Run `.specify/scripts/bash/update-agent-context.sh claude` for your AI assistant
   - If exists: Add only NEW tech from current plan
   - Preserve manual additions between markers
   - Update recent changes (keep last 3)
   - Keep under 150 lines for token efficiency
   - Output to repository root

**Output**: data-model.md, /contracts/*, failing tests, quickstart.md, agent-specific file

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach
*This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan*

**Task Generation Strategy**:
- Load `.specify/templates/tasks-template.md` as base
- Generate documentation creation tasks based on Phase 1 contracts and data model
- Each functional requirement (FR-001 to FR-012) → content creation task
- Each documentation section → writing and verification task
- Content validation and testing tasks
- Quality gates and review tasks

**Specific Task Categories**:
1. **Content Research Tasks [P]**: Analyze existing tool capabilities, extract all CLI options, catalog configuration fields
2. **Section Writing Tasks**: Create each major documentation section (Overview, Quick Start, CLI Reference, etc.)
3. **Example Creation Tasks [P]**: Develop working code examples, sample files, use case demonstrations
4. **Verification Tasks**: Test all examples, validate accuracy, check completeness
5. **Integration Tasks**: Assemble sections, create navigation, finalize formatting

**Ordering Strategy**:
- Research and analysis first (parallel execution possible)
- Content creation in logical dependency order (Overview → Quick Start → Usage → Advanced)
- Examples can be created in parallel with related sections
- Verification after each section completion
- Integration and final assembly last

**Estimated Output**: 15-20 numbered, ordered tasks in tasks.md focusing on documentation creation rather than code implementation

**IMPORTANT**: This phase is executed by the /tasks command, NOT by /plan

## Phase 3+: Future Implementation
*These phases are beyond the scope of the /plan command*

**Phase 3**: Task execution (/tasks command creates tasks.md)  
**Phase 4**: Implementation (execute tasks.md following constitutional principles)  
**Phase 5**: Validation (run tests, execute quickstart.md, performance validation)

## Complexity Tracking
*Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified*

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |


## Progress Tracking
*This checklist is updated during execution flow*

**Phase Status**:
- [x] Phase 0: Research complete (/plan command)
- [x] Phase 1: Design complete (/plan command)
- [x] Phase 2: Task planning complete (/plan command - describe approach only)
- [ ] Phase 3: Tasks generated (/tasks command)
- [ ] Phase 4: Implementation complete
- [ ] Phase 5: Validation passed

**Gate Status**:
- [x] Initial Constitution Check: PASS
- [x] Post-Design Constitution Check: PASS
- [x] All NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved
- [x] Complexity deviations documented (N/A - no deviations)
