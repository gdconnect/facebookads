# Feature Specification: BIE Enhancement - Complete Implementation

**Feature Branch**: `015-bie-enhancement-complete`
**Created**: 2025-09-24
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "BIE Enhancement - Complete markdown output and remaining features"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ’ Extracted: Complete BIE implementation gaps
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ’ Identified: markdown formatting, blindspot detection, comparison logic
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ’ All requirements derived from PRD verification report
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ’ User needs enhanced markdown output for iterative refinement
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ’ Each requirement addresses specific implementation gap
6. Identify Key Entities
   ’ Existing models need output formatting enhancements
7. Run Review Checklist
   ’ All requirements testable and clearly defined
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ¡ Quick Guidelines
-  Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- L Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- =e Written for business stakeholders, not developers

---

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
A developer who has already evaluated their business idea using the BIE tool wants to receive the results in a beautifully formatted markdown document with emojis, clear sections, and actionable checkboxes. They want to iterate on their idea based on the feedback and compare multiple versions to see improvements.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a completed business idea evaluation, **When** the user requests markdown output format, **Then** the system produces a formatted markdown document with emoji sections, grade in title, and checkbox action items
2. **Given** multiple business idea markdown files, **When** the user runs the compare command, **Then** the system provides a ranked comparison showing relative strengths and weaknesses
3. **Given** a business idea with vague monetization, **When** evaluation runs, **Then** the system detects and flags the "monetization later" blindspot
4. **Given** a business idea with long MVP timeline, **When** evaluation runs, **Then** the system detects and flags the "perfect before launch" trap

### Edge Cases
- What happens when comparing ideas with vastly different scores?
- How does the system handle markdown output for very low-grade ideas?
- What occurs when all compared ideas have similar scores?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

**Enhanced Markdown Output**
- **FR-001**: System MUST generate enhanced markdown output with the grade displayed in the title (e.g., "# [Idea Name] - Grade: B (72/100)")
- **FR-002**: System MUST include emoji-prefixed sections: =Ê Summary Scores, =¡ Original Idea, <¯ Refined Business Model, W Critical Questions, =¨ Red Flags,  Quick Wins, =€ Recommended MVP, =È Similar Success, = Next Iteration Prompts
- **FR-003**: System MUST format quick wins as markdown checkboxes (- [ ]) for actionable tracking
- **FR-004**: System MUST show scores with visual indicators ( for good,   for warning, L for poor)
- **FR-005**: System MUST preserve the original idea content in a dedicated section

**Blindspot Detection Completion**
- **FR-006**: System MUST detect "We'll figure out monetization later" pattern when monetization strategy is vague or missing
- **FR-007**: System MUST detect "Perfect before launch" trap when MVP timeline exceeds 60 days
- **FR-008**: System MUST provide specific advice for each detected blindspot

**Compare Command Implementation**
- **FR-009**: System MUST accept 2-10 business idea files for comparison
- **FR-010**: System MUST evaluate each idea independently using the same scoring algorithm
- **FR-011**: System MUST rank ideas by overall score and display in a comparison table
- **FR-012**: System MUST identify relative strengths and weaknesses for each idea
- **FR-013**: System MUST generate a summary recommendation indicating which idea to pursue

**Output Format Consistency**
- **FR-014**: System MUST support --output markdown flag to generate enhanced markdown
- **FR-015**: System MUST support --output both flag to generate both JSON and markdown outputs
- **FR-016**: System MUST maintain backwards compatibility with existing JSON output format

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **ComparisonResult**: Represents the output of comparing multiple ideas, containing ranked list, strengths/weaknesses, and recommendations
- **MarkdownFormatter**: Handles the conversion of evaluation results to enhanced markdown format (conceptual entity, not implementation detail)
- **BlindspotRule**: Expanded set of detection patterns including monetization and timeline checks
