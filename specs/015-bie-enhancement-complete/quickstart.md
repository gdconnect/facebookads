# Test comparison functionality
python bie.py compare idea1.md idea2.md idea3.md --output markdown

# Expected: Markdown comparison table with:
# - Ideas ranked by overall score
# - Comparison table with rank, name, grade, scores
# - Summary of grade distribution
# - Recommendation for which idea to pursue
# Verify: 3 ideas evaluated independently
# Verify: Ranking shows relative strengths/weaknesses
# Verify: Summary recommendation provided

# Test JSON output
python bie.py compare idea1.md idea2.md idea3.md --output json | head -20

# Expected: ComparisonResult JSON with ideas, ranking, recommendation
# Verify: All 3 ideas present in results
# Verify: Ranking array with proper structure
# Verify: Valid JSON format

cleanup: rm idea1.md idea2.md idea3.md
```

### 4. Output Format Consistency Test
```bash
# Create simple test idea
cat > format_test.md << 'EOF'
# Simple SaaS Tool

## Problem
Small businesses need simple project management.

## Solution
Lightweight project management tool.

## Target Customer
Teams of 5-15 people.

## Revenue Model
$10 per user per month.
EOF

# Test JSON output (backwards compatibility)
python bie.py evaluate format_test.md --output json > json_output.json

# Verify: Valid Envelope[EvaluatedIdea] structure
# Verify: No schema changes from existing implementation

# Test both output format
python bie.py evaluate format_test.md --output both

# Expected: JSON section followed by markdown section
# Verify: "=== JSON OUTPUT ===" separator
# Verify: "=== MARKDOWN OUTPUT ===" separator
# Verify: Both formats contain same underlying data

cleanup: rm format_test.md json_output.json
```

### 5. Edge Cases and Error Handling Test
```bash
# Test invalid file count for comparison
python bie.py compare idea1.md  # Should fail: need 2+ files
python bie.py compare $(for i in {1..11}; do echo "idea$i.md"; done)  # Should fail: max 10 files

# Test nonexistent file
python bie.py evaluate nonexistent.md  # Should return error envelope

# Test malformed markdown
echo "Not a valid business idea" > malformed.md
python bie.py evaluate malformed.md  # Should handle gracefully

cleanup: rm malformed.md
```

## Integration Test Scenarios

### User Story 1: Developer Iterating on Business Idea
**Scenario**: Developer evaluates idea, receives markdown feedback, refines idea based on feedback
```bash
# Step 1: Initial evaluation
python bie.py evaluate initial_idea.md --output markdown > feedback_v1.md

# Step 2: Developer reviews feedback, updates idea
# [Manual step: developer reads feedback_v1.md, updates initial_idea.md]

# Step 3: Re-evaluation to see improvements
python bie.py evaluate initial_idea.md --output markdown > feedback_v2.md

# Step 4: Compare feedback versions
# [Manual step: developer compares feedback_v1.md vs feedback_v2.md]

# Expected: Enhanced markdown provides actionable feedback for iteration
```

### User Story 2: Comparing Multiple Business Ideas
**Scenario**: Entrepreneur has 3 business ideas, wants to choose the best one
```bash
# Step 1: Evaluate each idea independently
for idea in idea_a.md idea_b.md idea_c.md; do
    python bie.py evaluate $idea --output json > "${idea%.md}_evaluation.json"
done

# Step 2: Direct comparison
python bie.py compare idea_a.md idea_b.md idea_c.md --output markdown > comparison_report.md

# Step 3: Review comparison report
cat comparison_report.md

# Expected: Clear recommendation with rationale for which idea to pursue
```

### User Story 3: Blindspot Detection and Advice
**Scenario**: Developer has idea with common pitfalls, needs specific guidance
```bash
# Test idea with monetization blindspot
python bie.py evaluate vague_monetization_idea.md --output markdown | grep -A5 "Red Flags"

# Expected: "We'll figure out monetization later" detected with specific advice

# Test idea with perfectionism blindspot
python bie.py evaluate perfectionist_idea.md --output markdown | grep -A5 "Red Flags"

# Expected: "Perfect before launch" trap detected with specific advice
```
