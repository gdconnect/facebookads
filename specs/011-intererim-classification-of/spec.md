# Feature Specification: Interim Content Classification with LLM Fallback

**Feature Branch**: `011-intererim-classification-of`
**Created**: 2025-09-21
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "intererim classification of article or essay would be helpful in further processing, would it be okay to have two llm calls when confidence in classification is low or there is a need for an interim llm calls?"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ’ If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ’ Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ’ Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ’ If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ’ Each requirement must be testable
   ’ Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ’ If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ’ If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ¡ Quick Guidelines
-  Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- L Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- =e Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
Content creators and editors need reliable classification of written content as either "article" or "essay" to enable appropriate downstream processing workflows. When initial rule-based classification yields low confidence results, the system should leverage LLM capabilities to provide accurate classification, ensuring content is processed through the correct editorial and publishing pipelines.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** content with clear article indicators (how-to, tutorial, news), **When** classification is requested, **Then** system returns "article" classification with high confidence using rule-based approach
2. **Given** content with clear essay indicators (personal reflection, opinion, narrative), **When** classification is requested, **Then** system returns "essay" classification with high confidence using rule-based approach
3. **Given** ambiguous content with mixed signals, **When** initial classification confidence is below threshold, **Then** system automatically invokes LLM for refined classification
4. **Given** content requiring interim classification during processing, **When** immediate classification is needed, **Then** system provides classification result within performance bounds allowing up to two LLM calls
5. **Given** LLM classification request, **When** processing completes, **Then** system returns classification with confidence score and reasoning

### Edge Cases
- What happens when both rule-based and LLM classification disagree?
- How does system handle content that doesn't clearly fit either article or essay categories?
- What occurs when LLM service is unavailable but classification is needed?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST classify written content as either "article" or "essay" based on content characteristics
- **FR-002**: System MUST provide confidence scores (0.0-1.0) for all classification decisions
- **FR-003**: System MUST support interim classification requests during content processing workflows
- **FR-004**: System MUST automatically invoke LLM classification when rule-based confidence falls below [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific confidence threshold not specified]
- **FR-005**: System MUST allow up to two LLM calls per classification request for enhanced accuracy
- **FR-006**: System MUST return classification results within [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: performance target not specified] to support real-time workflows
- **FR-007**: System MUST provide reasoning or explanation for LLM-based classification decisions
- **FR-008**: System MUST gracefully degrade to rule-based classification when LLM services are unavailable
- **FR-009**: System MUST distinguish between "article" (informational, instructional, factual) and "essay" (personal, argumentative, reflective) content types
- **FR-010**: System MUST support batch classification requests for processing multiple content pieces

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Content**: Text content requiring classification, contains body text, optional metadata, and source information
- **Classification Result**: Contains content type (article/essay), confidence score, classification method used, and optional reasoning
- **Classification Request**: Represents a classification task with content input, urgency level, and configuration parameters
- **Confidence Threshold**: Configurable boundary determining when LLM fallback is triggered
