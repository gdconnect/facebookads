# Research & Technical Analysis: Business Idea Evaluator

## Research Overview
All technical requirements have been clearly specified in the PRD documentation. No NEEDS CLARIFICATION markers were identified in the technical context as all aspects are well-defined.

## Technology Decisions

### Core Language & Runtime
**Decision**: Python 3.10+
**Rationale**:
- Modern type hints support (Required by PRD)
- Excellent ecosystem for LLM integration
- Cross-platform CLI compatibility
- Constitutional compliance (Article I)
**Alternatives considered**:
- Python 3.8/3.9: Rejected due to limited type hint features
- Node.js: Rejected due to constitutional mandate for Python single-file agents
- Go: Rejected due to less mature LLM integration ecosystem

### LLM Integration Framework
**Decision**: PydanticAI
**Rationale**:
- Constitutional compliance (Article X, XI)
- Native Pydantic v2 integration for structured extraction
- Built-in provider abstraction (OpenAI, Anthropic, Azure, etc.)
- Automatic budget enforcement and retry logic
- Structured response validation
**Alternatives considered**:
- OpenAI Python SDK: Rejected due to vendor lock-in and lack of structured extraction
- LangChain: Rejected due to complexity and constitutional preference for minimal dependencies
- Custom HTTP client: Rejected due to need for provider abstraction and retry logic

### Data Validation & Schema
**Decision**: Pydantic v2
**Rationale**:
- Constitutional requirement (Article II)
- JSON Schema generation for contract testing
- Field validators for business rule enforcement
- Type safety and IDE support
- Mature ecosystem and documentation
**Alternatives considered**:
- Dataclasses: Rejected due to lack of validation and schema generation
- Marshmallow: Rejected due to constitutional preference for Pydantic
- Custom validation: Rejected due to maintenance overhead

### CLI Framework
**Decision**: argparse (stdlib)
**Rationale**:
- Constitutional preference for stdlib (Article I)
- Zero external dependencies
- Sufficient for required CLI functionality
- Built-in help generation and error handling
**Alternatives considered**:
- Click: Rejected due to external dependency
- Fire: Rejected due to magic behavior conflicting with explicit design
- Typer: Rejected due to external dependency

### Configuration Management
**Decision**: Pydantic Settings with env binding
**Rationale**:
- Constitutional compliance (Article V)
- Hierarchical configuration support (defaults → config file → env vars → CLI flags)
- Type-safe configuration parsing
- Built-in environment variable binding
**Alternatives considered**:
- ConfigParser: Rejected due to lack of type safety and env binding
- YAML config only: Rejected due to missing env var support
- Environment variables only: Rejected due to poor user experience

### File I/O & Path Handling
**Decision**: pathlib (stdlib)
**Rationale**:
- Modern, object-oriented path handling
- Cross-platform compatibility
- Constitutional preference for stdlib
- Better error handling than os.path
**Alternatives considered**:
- os.path: Rejected due to antiquated API and cross-platform issues
- External path libraries: Rejected due to constitutional preference for stdlib

### Markdown Processing
**Decision**: Built-in text processing with regex
**Rationale**:
- Simple extraction requirements (sections and key-value pairs)
- Reduces external dependencies per constitutional preference
- Adequate for business idea markdown structure
- Performance and reliability advantages
**Alternatives considered**:
- markdown library: Rejected due to overkill for simple extraction
- Beautiful Soup: Rejected due to HTML focus and external dependency
- mistletoe: Rejected due to complexity for simple text extraction

### Logging Framework
**Decision**: Python logging (stdlib) with structured JSONL
**Rationale**:
- Constitutional requirement (Article XVIII)
- JSONL output to STDERR for machine processing
- Structured event logging support
- Performance and reliability
**Alternatives considered**:
- structlog: Rejected due to external dependency
- Custom logging: Rejected due to constitutional structured logging requirements
- Print statements: Rejected due to lack of structure and filtering

### Testing Framework
**Decision**: pytest
**Rationale**:
- Constitutional testing requirements (Article VIII)
- Excellent fixture system for golden tests
- Contract testing capabilities
- Snapshot testing support for large outputs
- Industry standard for Python testing
**Alternatives considered**:
- unittest: Rejected due to verbose syntax and limited fixtures
- nose2: Rejected due to declining adoption
- Custom testing: Rejected due to maintenance overhead

## Architecture Decisions

### Multi-Pass LLM Strategy
**Decision**: Sequential enrichment with intermediate validation
**Rationale**:
- Enables specialized prompts for each analysis phase
- Reduces token usage through focused context
- Allows incremental validation and error recovery
- Supports different temperature settings per phase
**Implementation**: 5-pass approach (Extract → Business Model → Scalability → Risk → Synthesis)

### Scoring Algorithm Design
**Decision**: Weighted sum with configurable weights
**Rationale**:
- Transparent and auditable scoring methodology
- Configurable for different business contexts
- Mathematical consistency and reproducibility
- Clear factor contribution analysis
**Implementation**: Separate scoring functions per dimension with documented weight rationales

### Error Handling Strategy
**Decision**: Graceful degradation with fallback responses
**Rationale**:
- LLM API failures are expected in production
- User should receive useful output even with partial failures
- Constitutional requirement for error handling (Article VII)
- Retry logic with exponential backoff for transient failures

### Output Format Strategy
**Decision**: Dual format support (JSON for automation, Markdown for humans)
**Rationale**:
- JSON enables programmatic processing and comparison
- Enhanced Markdown provides readable iteration support
- Both formats generated from same structured data
- Supports different user workflow preferences

## Performance Analysis

### Token Budget Management
- Input phase: ~500 tokens per analysis pass (2500 total)
- Output phase: ~1500 tokens per analysis pass (7500 total)
- Total budget: ~10K tokens per evaluation
- Cost estimate: $0.10-0.15 per evaluation (GPT-4 pricing)

### Runtime Performance
- File I/O operations: <10ms
- LLM API calls: 5-15 seconds per pass (75 seconds total)
- Local processing: <100ms
- Total estimated runtime: 80-120 seconds (within 2-minute requirement)

### Memory Usage
- Markdown file processing: <1MB memory footprint
- Pydantic model instances: <100KB
- JSON output generation: <500KB
- Total process memory: <50MB (well within constraints)

## Integration Patterns

### Provider Abstraction
- PydanticAI provides unified interface across OpenAI, Anthropic, Azure
- Configuration-driven provider selection
- Automatic retry and rate limiting
- Budget enforcement at provider level

### Configuration Hierarchy
1. Sensible defaults for immediate use
2. Config file for persistent settings
3. Environment variables for deployment
4. CLI flags for one-time overrides

### Extensibility Points
- Custom scoring weights via configuration
- Pluggable blindspot detection rules
- Configurable prompt templates
- Output format extensions

## Risk Mitigation

### LLM Dependency Risks
- Multiple provider support reduces vendor lock-in
- Fallback to deterministic responses on failures
- Local caching of successful responses
- Budget limits prevent runaway costs

### Performance Risks
- Async processing for multiple file comparison
- Configurable timeouts prevent hanging
- Progress indicators for user feedback
- Early termination on validation failures

### Quality Risks
- Golden test suite with known good/bad examples
- Contract testing ensures schema compliance
- Integration testing validates end-to-end flows
- Property-based testing for scoring edge cases

## Conclusion

All technology choices align with constitutional requirements and business objectives. The single-file architecture with PydanticAI integration provides a robust, maintainable solution for business idea evaluation while meeting performance and reliability requirements.

Research complete - no unresolved technical unknowns remain.
