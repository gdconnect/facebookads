# Tasks: LLM-Enhanced Brand Identity Processing

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/002-update-the-specs/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Load plan.md from feature directory
   ✓ Loaded: Python 3.11+, LLM integration (openai/anthropic), single-file extension
   ✓ Extract: tech stack, libraries, structure
2. Load optional design documents:
   ✓ data-model.md: 15+ enhancement models → model tasks
   ✓ contracts/llm-enhancement-interface.md: CLI enhancement contract → test tasks
   ✓ research.md: LLM integration patterns, prompt engineering → setup tasks
3. Generate tasks by category:
   ✓ Setup: LLM dependencies, enhancement test structure
   ✓ Tests: Enhancement contracts, LLM integration tests, workflow validation
   ✓ Core: Enhancement models, LLM processing, gap analysis, design strategy
   ✓ Integration: CLI enhancement, session management, user feedback
   ✓ Polish: performance optimization, documentation, examples
4. Apply task rules:
   ✓ Different test files = mark [P] for parallel
   ✓ Single file extension = sequential core implementation
   ✓ Tests before implementation (TDD)
5. Number tasks sequentially (T001, T002...)
6. Generate dependency graph
7. Create parallel execution examples
8. Validate task completeness:
   ✓ All enhancement contracts have tests?
   ✓ All LLM models implemented?
   ✓ All enhancement workflows covered?
9. Return: SUCCESS (tasks ready for execution)
```

## Format: `[ID] [P?] Description`
- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different test files, independent validation)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions
- **Single file extension**: `brand_identity_generator.py` enhanced with LLM capabilities
- **Tests**: `tests/` directory with contract, integration, unit subdirectories for enhancement
- Constitutional requirement: Maintain single Python file architecture

## Dependencies

### Sequential Dependencies (Due to Single File Extension)
- Setup (T001-T003) before all tests
- All tests (T004-T021) before any implementation
- Models (T022-T026) before processing logic (T027-T032)
- Processing logic before CLI interface (T033-T036)
- Core implementation before integration (T037-T041)
- Integration before polish (T042-T048)

### Within Phase Dependencies
- T022 (LLM models) blocks T027 (LLM client integration)
- T023 (gap analysis models) blocks T029 (gap analysis engine)
- T024 (enhancement models) blocks T030-T032 (enhancement logic)
- T025 (user interaction models) blocks T034-T035 (interactive interface)
- T033 (argument parsing) blocks T034-T036 (enhanced CLI functionality)

```

## Notes
- [P] tasks = different test files, no dependencies
- Single file constraint means core implementation (T022-T036) must be sequential
- Verify all enhancement tests fail before implementing corresponding LLM functionality
- Commit after each major enhancement milestone
- Constitutional compliance: maintain single file while adding comprehensive LLM capabilities

## Task Generation Rules Applied

1. **From CLI Enhancement Contract**:
   - Each enhancement flag → test and implementation task (T004-T009, T033-T036)
   - Interactive features → user interaction tasks (T006, T034)
   - Session management → workflow tasks (T009, T035)

2. **From Data Models**:
   - Each model group → dedicated implementation task (T022-T026)
   - Model validation → parallel test tasks (T016-T021)
   - Workflow models → integration tasks (T037-T041)

3. **From Quickstart Scenarios**:
   - Gap analysis workflow → integration tests (T011, T029)
   - Enhancement workflows → comprehensive testing (T010-T015)
   - User interaction patterns → interface development (T034-T035)

4. **From Research Decisions**:
   - LLM integration patterns → provider support (T027, T038)
   - Prompt engineering → structured prompts (T028)
   - Performance optimization → caching and efficiency (T039, T043)

## Validation Checklist

- [x] All CLI enhancement behaviors have corresponding tests
- [x] All LLM enhancement models have implementation tasks
- [x] All tests come before implementation (TDD)
- [x] Parallel tasks are truly independent (different test files)
- [x] Each task specifies exact file path or component
- [x] Sequential dependencies respect single-file architecture
- [x] Constitutional requirements integrated throughout
- [x] Backward compatibility preserved
