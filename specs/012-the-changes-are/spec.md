# Feature Specification: Enhanced Article Outline Generator with Interim Classification

**Feature Branch**: `012-the-changes-are`
**Created**: 2025-09-21
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "the changes are meant to be for agents/article_outline_generator/article_outline_generator.py not agents/content_classifier/content_classifier.py"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ’ If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ’ Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ’ Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ’ If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ’ Each requirement must be testable
   ’ Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ’ If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ’ If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ¡ Quick Guidelines
-  Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- L Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- =e Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
Content creators and editors using the article outline generator need enhanced classification capabilities that can distinguish between article and essay content types during the outline generation process. When the existing rule-based classification has low confidence, the system should provide interim classification results and optionally use LLM assistance for more accurate content type determination, ensuring the generated outlines follow appropriate structural templates.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** content with clear article characteristics (how-to, tutorial, analysis), **When** outline generation is requested, **Then** system correctly classifies as "article" and generates appropriate instructional/informational outline structure
2. **Given** content with clear essay characteristics (personal opinion, memoir, argumentative), **When** outline generation is requested, **Then** system correctly classifies as "essay" and generates appropriate narrative/persuasive outline structure
3. **Given** ambiguous content that could be either article or essay, **When** outline generation is requested with low rule-based confidence, **Then** system provides interim classification result and optionally enhances accuracy with LLM assistance
4. **Given** content processing workflow requiring immediate classification, **When** interim classification is needed during outline generation, **Then** system provides classification result within performance bounds to support real-time processing
5. **Given** existing article outline generator functionality, **When** classification enhancements are added, **Then** all existing outline generation capabilities continue to work without regression

### Edge Cases
- What happens when content doesn't clearly fit either article or essay categories?
- How does the system handle classification disagreement between rules and LLM?
- What occurs when LLM services are unavailable but enhanced classification is requested?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST enhance existing article outline generator with improved article vs essay classification
- **FR-002**: System MUST maintain backward compatibility with existing outline generation functionality
- **FR-003**: System MUST provide interim classification results during outline generation workflow
- **FR-004**: System MUST support optional LLM-enhanced classification when rule-based confidence is below [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific confidence threshold not specified]
- **FR-005**: System MUST allow up to two LLM calls per outline generation request for improved classification accuracy
- **FR-006**: System MUST generate different outline templates based on content type (article vs essay)
- **FR-007**: System MUST return classification confidence scores along with outline results
- **FR-008**: System MUST provide reasoning for classification decisions when LLM is used
- **FR-009**: System MUST maintain existing performance targets while adding classification enhancements
- **FR-010**: System MUST gracefully degrade to existing behavior when classification enhancements fail

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Enhanced Classification Result**: Extended classification output with confidence scores, method used, and reasoning
- **Content Type Template**: Different outline structures for article vs essay content types
- **Classification Configuration**: Settings controlling when and how LLM enhancement is used
- **Interim Classification State**: Temporary classification results available during outline generation process
