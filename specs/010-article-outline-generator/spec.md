# Feature Specification: Article Outline Generator

**Feature Branch**: `010-article-outline-generator`
**Created**: 2025-09-21
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "article-outline-generator please read @agents/_shared/schemas/article_outline_generator.json.schema and use it as a basis of creating outlines from a markdown documment description of an article or story with a structured output based on the json schema . The goal of the program is to quickly scaffold a well thought out, LLM enriched article outline flexible enough and versatile enough for different story or article types."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ’ If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ’ Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ’ Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ’ If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ’ Each requirement must be testable
   ’ Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ’ If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ’ If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ¡ Quick Guidelines
-  Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- L Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- =e Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
Content creators, writers, and editors need to quickly generate comprehensive, structured outlines for articles and stories from markdown descriptions. They want to transform their rough ideas and content descriptions into well-organized, hierarchical outlines that include section titles, summaries, key points, and word count estimates to guide their writing process.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a markdown document describing an article about "sustainable gardening practices", **When** the user processes it through the outline generator, **Then** the system produces a structured JSON outline with sections for introduction, main topics (composting, water conservation, plant selection), conclusion, and appropriate metadata (content type: article, detected language, depth levels)

2. **Given** a markdown description of a fictional story about space exploration, **When** the user generates an outline, **Then** the system creates a story-type outline with narrative sections (setup, conflict, resolution) including character development points and plot progression with appropriate word count estimates

3. **Given** a simple one-paragraph description in markdown, **When** processed, **Then** the system generates a basic outline with at least an introduction and conclusion, automatically determining appropriate depth level based on content complexity

### Edge Cases
- What happens when the markdown input is empty or contains only whitespace?
- How does the system handle markdown with no clear structural cues or topic boundaries?
- What occurs when content description is ambiguous between article and story format?
- How does the system respond to markdown in languages other than English?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST accept markdown document descriptions as input containing article or story concepts
- **FR-002**: System MUST automatically detect and classify content type as either "article" or "story" based on input content
- **FR-003**: System MUST generate hierarchical outline structures with configurable depth levels (1-6)
- **FR-004**: System MUST produce structured JSON output conforming to the article_outline_generator.json.schema specification
- **FR-005**: System MUST include metadata for each generated outline (content type, detected language, depth, section count, generation timestamp)
- **FR-006**: System MUST create section objects with titles, summaries, key points, and optional word count estimates
- **FR-007**: System MUST support nested subsections with appropriate heading level increments
- **FR-008**: System MUST generate stable section IDs/slugs for consistent referencing
- **FR-009**: System MUST detect input language and include it in metadata
- **FR-010**: System MUST provide 1-3 sentence summaries for each major section
- **FR-011**: System MUST generate relevant key points as bullet items for each section
- **FR-012**: System MUST be flexible enough to handle various article types (informational, how-to, opinion, news) and story types (fiction, memoir, case study)

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Article/Story Description**: Markdown input containing content concept, topic details, and structural hints
- **Outline Metadata**: Content classification, language detection, structural parameters (depth, section count), generation timestamp, and optional notes
- **Section**: Core outline component with unique identifier, hierarchical level, title, summary, key points, word count estimate, and optional nested subsections
- **Content Classification**: Differentiation between article-type content (informational, instructional) and story-type content (narrative, sequential)
