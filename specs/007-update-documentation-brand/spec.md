# Feature Specification: Update Brand Generator Documentation

**Feature Branch**: `007-update-documentation-brand`
**Created**: 2025-09-20
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "update documentation brand generator ... simplify KISS the documenation to focus more on the developer usage on local computer not deployment. also make sure the docs are upto date with the current state of the program e.g fonts selection, google api key etc"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ’ Focus on developer usage, local development, font selection features
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ’ Actors: Local developers, Contributors, Font feature users
   ’ Actions: Simplify docs, Update features, Focus on developer usage
   ’ Data: Current documentation, Font selection features, Google API key setup
   ’ Constraints: KISS principle, Local computer focus
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ’ Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ’ Primary: Developer setting up brand generator locally with font features
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ’ Each requirement must be testable
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
   ’ Documentation files, Font selection features, Configuration
7. Run Review Checklist
   ’ Focus on developer experience and completeness
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ¡ Quick Guidelines
-  Focus on WHAT developers need and WHY
- L Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- =e Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
A developer wants to set up the brand identity generator on their local machine to enhance brand descriptions with automatic font selection. They need clear, concise documentation that gets them running quickly without deployment complexity or outdated information.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a new developer discovers the brand generator, **When** they follow the documentation, **Then** they can set up and run the tool locally within 10 minutes
2. **Given** a developer wants to use font selection features, **When** they follow the Google API key setup guide, **Then** they can successfully configure and use automatic font selection
3. **Given** a developer needs basic usage examples, **When** they read the simplified documentation, **Then** they understand how to enhance brand files without reading extensive deployment sections
4. **Given** a developer encounters issues, **When** they check the troubleshooting section, **Then** they find solutions for common local development problems

### Edge Cases
- What happens when documentation references features not yet implemented?
- How does documentation handle different operating systems (Windows, macOS, Linux)?
- What if the user doesn't have or want Google Fonts API access?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: Documentation MUST focus primarily on local developer setup and usage rather than deployment scenarios
- **FR-002**: Documentation MUST include up-to-date information about font selection features and Google Fonts API key configuration
- **FR-003**: Documentation MUST follow KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid) principles with concise, actionable content
- **FR-004**: Documentation MUST provide working examples for all major features including font selection
- **FR-005**: Documentation MUST include a quick start section that gets developers running in under 10 minutes
- **FR-006**: Documentation MUST clearly explain Google Fonts API key setup and configuration options
- **FR-007**: Documentation MUST remove or minimize deployment-focused content that doesn't apply to local development
- **FR-008**: Documentation MUST include troubleshooting for common local development issues
- **FR-009**: Documentation MUST reflect the current state of the program including all implemented features
- **FR-010**: Documentation MUST provide clear examples of font selection behavior and configuration

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Documentation Files**: README.md, brand_identity_generator.md, and related documentation
- **Configuration Examples**: Developer configuration snippets, environment variable examples
- **Feature Coverage**: Font selection, Google API integration, local setup procedures
- **Code Examples**: Working command-line examples and configuration samples
