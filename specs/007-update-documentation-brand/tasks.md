# Tasks: Update Brand Generator Documentation

**Input**: Design documents from `/var/www/html/facebookads/specs/007-update-documentation-brand/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (✅), research.md (✅), data-model.md (✅), contracts/ (✅), quickstart.md (✅)

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Load plan.md from feature directory ✅
   → Tech stack: Documentation (Markdown), Testing: Manual validation
   → Structure: Single project with documentation updates
2. Load design documents ✅:
   → data-model.md: DocumentationFile, ContentSection, CodeExample entities
   → contracts/: 6 documentation validation contracts (DOC-QS-001 through DOC-INTEGRATION-006)
   → quickstart.md: 5-step developer workflow scenarios
3. Generate validation tasks by category:
   → Setup: validation environment and test framework
   → Tests: contract validation, compliance checks
   → Content: section validation, example verification
   → Integration: workflow testing, cross-platform validation
   → Polish: final quality assurance and performance validation
4. Apply task rules:
   → Different validation areas = mark [P] for parallel
   → Content verification = sequential (depends on file state)
   → Validation before quality assurance
5. Number tasks sequentially (T001, T002...)
6. Generate dependency graph for documentation validation
7. Create parallel execution examples for independent validations
8. Validate task completeness ✅:
   → All contracts have validation tests ✅
   → All documentation sections covered ✅
   → All user workflows validated ✅
9. Return: SUCCESS (tasks ready for execution)
```

## Format: `[ID] [P?] Description`
- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different validation areas, no dependencies)
- **Implementation already complete** - tasks focus on validation and compliance
- Include exact file paths for all validation targets

## Path Conventions
- **Documentation files**: `/var/www/html/facebookads/README.md`, `/var/www/html/facebookads/docs/brand_identity_generator.md`
- **Tool location**: `/var/www/html/facebookads/brand_identity_generator.py`
- **Test environment**: `/var/www/html/facebookads/`
- **Contracts**: `/var/www/html/facebookads/specs/007-update-documentation-brand/contracts/`

## Phase 3.1: Setup & Environment
- [ ] T001 Create documentation validation test environment and dependencies
- [ ] T002 [P] Verify brand generator tool functionality and setup for testing
- [ ] T003 [P] Create test brand files for validation scenarios

## Phase 3.2: Content Validation (Must Complete Before Performance Testing)
**CRITICAL: Content must be validated before user experience testing**
- [ ] T004 [P] Validate README.md content structure and KISS compliance per data model
- [ ] T005 [P] Validate docs/brand_identity_generator.md section completeness per data model
- [ ] T006 [P] Verify all code examples are executable and produce expected output
- [ ] T007 [P] Validate cross-reference links and internal documentation consistency
- [ ] T008 [P] Verify font selection features documentation completeness per FR-002, FR-006, FR-010

## Phase 3.3: Contract Validation (ONLY after content is validated)
- [ ] T009 Execute Contract DOC-QS-001: Quick Start Performance Testing (≤10 minutes)
- [ ] T010 Execute Contract DOC-FS-002: Font Selection Documentation Completeness
- [ ] T011 Execute Contract DOC-KISS-003: KISS Principle Compliance Testing
- [ ] T012 Execute Contract DOC-STATE-004: Current Program State Accuracy Validation
- [ ] T013 Execute Contract DOC-LOCAL-005: Local Developer Focus Verification
- [ ] T014 Cross-platform documentation instruction validation (Windows, macOS, Linux)

## Phase 3.4: User Workflow Integration
- [ ] T015 Execute quickstart.md Step 1-5 workflow timing validation (new developer simulation)
- [ ] T016 Test Google Fonts API setup workflow per quickstart.md instructions
- [ ] T017 Validate troubleshooting scenarios and solution effectiveness
- [ ] T018 Test documentation accessibility for different developer experience levels

## Phase 3.5: Quality Assurance & Polish
- [ ] T019 [P] Performance validation: Quick start timing meets <10 minute requirement
- [ ] T020 [P] Execute integration contract DOC-INTEGRATION-006: Full system validation
- [ ] T021 [P] Word count and KISS principle metrics validation per data model constraints
- [ ] T022 Documentation consistency and style guide compliance check
- [ ] T023 Final documentation quality gate and publication readiness verification

## Dependencies
- Content validation (T004-T008) before contract testing (T009-T014)
- T001 blocks T002-T003 (environment setup first)
- T009 blocks T015 (quick start contract before workflow timing)
- T015-T018 before final quality assurance (T019-T023)
- All validation before T023 (final gate)

## Parallel Execution Examples

### Content Validation (T004-T008)
```bash
# Launch content validation tasks together:
Task: "Validate README.md content structure and KISS compliance per data model at /var/www/html/facebookads/README.md"
Task: "Validate docs/brand_identity_generator.md section completeness per data model at /var/www/html/facebookads/docs/brand_identity_generator.md"
Task: "Verify all code examples are executable and produce expected output in both documentation files"
Task: "Validate cross-reference links and internal documentation consistency across all files"
Task: "Verify font selection features documentation completeness per FR-002, FR-006, FR-010 requirements"
```

### Setup Tasks (T002-T003)
```bash
# Launch setup tasks together:
Task: "Verify brand generator tool functionality and setup for testing at /var/www/html/facebookads/brand_identity_generator.py"

3. **Feature Coverage**: Font selection fully documented per FR-002
4. **Performance**: Quick start achieves <10 minute goal per FR-005
5. **Usability**: All workflows tested across platforms
6. **Consistency**: Cross-references valid, examples work

### Validation Metrics
- README.md: ≤1000 words ✅ (verified in implementation)
- Main docs: ≤5000 words ✅ (verified in implementation)

## Notes
- **Implementation Complete**: Documentation already updated, tasks focus on validation
- **[P] tasks**: Different validation areas, no file conflicts
- **Sequential tasks**: Depend on content state or previous validation results
- **Validation-first**: Ensure quality before declaring success
- **Contract-driven**: All functional requirements must pass validation tests

## Task Generation Rules Applied

1. **From Contracts (6 validation contracts)**:
   - DOC-QS-001 → T009 (Quick start performance)
   - DOC-FS-002 → T010 (Font selection completeness)
   - DOC-KISS-003 → T011 (KISS compliance)
   - DOC-STATE-004 → T012 (Program state accuracy)
   - DOC-LOCAL-005 → T013 (Local developer focus)
   - DOC-INTEGRATION-006 → T020 (Full integration)

2. **From Data Model (5 core entities)**:
   - DocumentationFile → T004, T005 (file validation)
   - ContentSection → T005, T007 (section validation)
   - CodeExample → T006 (example verification)
   - FeatureDocumentation → T008 (feature coverage)
   - UserWorkflow → T015, T016 (workflow testing)

3. **From Quickstart Scenarios**:
   - 5-step workflow → T015 (timing validation)
   - Google API setup → T016 (setup workflow)
   - Troubleshooting → T017 (solution testing)

4. **Ordering Applied**:
   - Setup (T001-T003) → Content Validation (T004-T008) → Contract Testing (T009-T014) → Workflow Testing (T015-T018) → Quality Assurance (T019-T023)
