# Implementation Plan: Update Brand Generator Documentation

**Branch**: `007-update-documentation-brand` | **Date**: 2025-09-20 | **Spec**: [spec.md](/var/www/html/facebookads/specs/007-update-documentation-brand/spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/var/www/html/facebookads/specs/007-update-documentation-brand/spec.md`

## Execution Flow (/plan command scope)
```
1. Load feature spec from Input path
   → If not found: ERROR "No feature spec at {path}"
2. Fill Technical Context (scan for NEEDS CLARIFICATION)
   → Detect Project Type from context (web=frontend+backend, mobile=app+api)
   → Set Structure Decision based on project type
3. Fill the Constitution Check section based on the content of the constitution document.
4. Evaluate Constitution Check section below
   → If violations exist: Document in Complexity Tracking
   → If no justification possible: ERROR "Simplify approach first"
   → Update Progress Tracking: Initial Constitution Check
5. Execute Phase 0 → research.md
   → If NEEDS CLARIFICATION remain: ERROR "Resolve unknowns"
6. Execute Phase 1 → contracts, data-model.md, quickstart.md, agent-specific template file (e.g., `CLAUDE.md` for Claude Code, `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for GitHub Copilot, `GEMINI.md` for Gemini CLI, `QWEN.md` for Qwen Code or `AGENTS.md` for opencode).
7. Re-evaluate Constitution Check section
   → If new violations: Refactor design, return to Phase 1
   → Update Progress Tracking: Post-Design Constitution Check
8. Plan Phase 2 → Describe task generation approach (DO NOT create tasks.md)
9. STOP - Ready for /tasks command
```

**IMPORTANT**: The /plan command STOPS at step 7. Phases 2-4 are executed by other commands:
- Phase 2: /tasks command creates tasks.md
- Phase 3-4: Implementation execution (manual or via tools)

## Summary
Simplify and update brand generator documentation following KISS principles to focus on local developer usage rather than deployment. Update documentation to reflect current program state including font selection features and Google Fonts API integration. The documentation has already been successfully updated and this plan validates the implementation approach.

## Technical Context
**Language/Version**: Documentation (Markdown) - language agnostic for Python 3.11+ tool
**Primary Dependencies**: N/A (Documentation feature)
**Storage**: File system - Markdown files (README.md, docs/brand_identity_generator.md)
**Testing**: Manual validation via user scenarios and acceptance criteria
**Target Platform**: Local developer environments (Windows, macOS, Linux)
**Project Type**: Documentation - single project with documentation updates
**Performance Goals**: <10 minute setup time for new developers per FR-005
**Constraints**: KISS principles, focus on local usage, remove deployment content per FR-001, FR-007
**Scale/Scope**: 2 documentation files, 10 functional requirements, developer-focused audience

## Constitution Check
*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

**Constitutional Compliance Analysis**:
- ✅ **Single File Python Programs**: N/A - Documentation feature only
- ✅ **Best Practice Adherence**: N/A - Documentation feature only
- ✅ **Comprehensive Documentation**: APPLICABLE - Feature improves documentation quality
- ✅ **Pydantic V2 Integration**: N/A - No code changes required
- ✅ **Self-Contained Design**: APPLICABLE - Documentation updates maintain self-contained tool design
- ✅ **Developer Productivity**: APPLICABLE - Feature directly improves developer experience per FR-005
- ✅ **Type Safety & IDE Compliance**: N/A - Documentation feature only

**Violations**: None identified - Documentation feature aligns with constitutional goals of developer productivity and comprehensive documentation.

**Gate Status**: ✅ PASS - Proceeds to Phase 0

**Post-Design Re-evaluation**:
✅ No new constitutional violations introduced in Phase 1 design
✅ Data model aligns with self-contained design principles
✅ Documentation contracts support developer productivity goals
✅ Quick start approach maintains constitutional simplicity requirements

**Final Gate Status**: ✅ PASS - Ready for Phase 2 planning

**Structure Decision**: Option 1 (Single project) - Documentation updates to existing single-file Python tool

## Phase 0: Outline & Research
1. **Extract unknowns from Technical Context** above:
   - For each NEEDS CLARIFICATION → research task
   - For each dependency → best practices task
   - For each integration → patterns task

2. **Generate and dispatch research agents**:
   ```
   For each unknown in Technical Context:
     Task: "Research {unknown} for {feature context}"
   For each technology choice:
     Task: "Find best practices for {tech} in {domain}"
   ```

3. **Consolidate findings** in `research.md` using format:
   - Decision: [what was chosen]
   - Rationale: [why chosen]
   - Alternatives considered: [what else evaluated]

**Output**: research.md with all NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts
*Prerequisites: research.md complete*

1. **Extract entities from feature spec** → `data-model.md`:
   - Entity name, fields, relationships
   - Validation rules from requirements
   - State transitions if applicable

2. **Generate API contracts** from functional requirements:
   - For each user action → endpoint
   - Use standard REST/GraphQL patterns
   - Output OpenAPI/GraphQL schema to `/contracts/`

3. **Generate contract tests** from contracts:
   - One test file per endpoint
   - Assert request/response schemas
   - Tests must fail (no implementation yet)

4. **Extract test scenarios** from user stories:
   - Each story → integration test scenario
   - Quickstart test = story validation steps

5. **Update agent file incrementally** (O(1) operation):
   - Run `.specify/scripts/bash/update-agent-context.sh claude` for your AI assistant
   - If exists: Add only NEW tech from current plan
   - Preserve manual additions between markers
   - Update recent changes (keep last 3)
   - Keep under 150 lines for token efficiency
   - Output to repository root

**Output**: data-model.md, /contracts/*, failing tests, quickstart.md, agent-specific file

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach
*This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan*

**Documentation-Specific Task Generation Strategy**:
- Load `.specify/templates/tasks-template.md` as base
- Generate validation tasks from documentation contracts
- Create content verification tasks from data model entities
- Generate user workflow validation tasks from quickstart scenarios
- **Note**: Implementation already complete - tasks focus on validation and compliance

**Ordering Strategy**:
- Content validation before contract testing
- Individual section validation before integration testing
- KISS compliance checks before performance validation
- Mark [P] for parallel execution (independent validation tasks)

**Expected Task Categories**:
1. **Content Validation Tasks** (5-7 tasks)
   - README.md content validation [P]
   - Documentation section completeness [P]
   - Code example verification [P]
   - Cross-reference link validation [P]

2. **Contract Testing Tasks** (5-6 tasks)
   - Quick start performance testing
   - Font selection documentation validation
   - KISS principle compliance testing
   - Current program state accuracy verification
   - Local developer focus validation

3. **User Workflow Validation** (3-4 tasks)
   - New developer quick start timing
   - Font selection setup validation
   - Troubleshooting scenario testing

4. **Quality Assurance Tasks** (2-3 tasks)
   - Documentation consistency check
   - Cross-platform instruction validation
   - Final integration testing

**Estimated Output**: 15-20 numbered validation and testing tasks in tasks.md

**Special Considerations for Documentation Tasks**:
- Most tasks are validation rather than implementation
- Focus on contract compliance and user experience validation
- Emphasize timing and usability testing
- Include cross-platform validation where applicable

**IMPORTANT**: This phase is executed by the /tasks command, NOT by /plan

## Phase 3+: Future Implementation
*These phases are beyond the scope of the /plan command*

**Phase 3**: Task execution (/tasks command creates tasks.md)  
**Phase 4**: Implementation (execute tasks.md following constitutional principles)  
**Phase 5**: Validation (run tests, execute quickstart.md, performance validation)

## Complexity Tracking
*Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified*

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |


## Progress Tracking
*This checklist is updated during execution flow*
