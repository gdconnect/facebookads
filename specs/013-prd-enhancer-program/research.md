# Research: PRD Enhancer Program

**Date**: 2025-09-23
**Feature**: 013-prd-enhancer-program

## Research Summary

All technical specifications were clearly defined in the original PRD document. No additional research was required as all technology choices, constraints, and implementation approaches are explicitly documented.

## Technology Decisions

### 1. Python Language & Version
- **Decision**: Python 3.11+
- **Rationale**: Required for PydanticAI compatibility and modern type annotations
- **Alternatives considered**: Python 3.9/3.10 (rejected - PydanticAI requires 3.11+)

### 2. AI Integration Framework
- **Decision**: PydanticAI with Claude-3-haiku
- **Rationale**:
  - Follows constitutional requirement for PydanticAI
  - Claude-3-haiku is cheapest/fastest model
  - Typed response parsing built-in
  - Budget enforcement capabilities
- **Alternatives considered**:
  - Direct API calls (rejected - constitutional violation)
  - Other models (rejected - cost constraints)

### 3. Core Dependencies
- **Decision**: pydantic>=2, pydantic-ai, markdown parser only
- **Rationale**:
  - Minimal dependency principle from constitution
  - All dependencies are constitutional approved
  - Pydantic v2 required for modern validation
- **Alternatives considered**:
  - Additional ML libraries (rejected - complexity budget)
  - Web frameworks (rejected - not needed for CLI tool)

### 4. Markdown Processing
- **Decision**: Standard Python markdown parser
- **Rationale**:
  - Simple text processing sufficient
  - Constitutional preference for stdlib where possible
  - No complex parsing requirements
- **Alternatives considered**:
  - Custom markdown parser (rejected - unnecessary complexity)
  - Rich text processors (rejected - overkill)

### 5. Fallback Strategy
- **Decision**: Regex patterns for offline operation
- **Rationale**:
  - Constitutional requirement for fail-fast operation
  - Deterministic fallbacks specified in PRD
  - No external service dependencies
- **Alternatives considered**:
  - Local ML models (rejected - complexity/size constraints)
  - Rule engines (rejected - overkill for simple patterns)

### 6. File Structure
- **Decision**: Single Python file in agents/prd_enhancer/
- **Rationale**:
  - Constitutional mandate for single-file agents
  - Simplicity principle
  - Easy distribution and maintenance
- **Alternatives considered**:
  - Multi-file package (rejected - constitutional violation)
  - Installable package (rejected - complexity budget)

### 7. Testing Strategy
- **Decision**: pytest with contract/integration/golden tests
- **Rationale**:
  - Constitutional testing requirements
  - PRD specifies specific test scenarios
  - Golden tests for output validation
- **Alternatives considered**:
  - unittest (rejected - pytest preferred in constitution)
  - Property-based testing only (rejected - need specific scenarios)

### 8. Performance Approach
- **Decision**: Sequential processing with timeout enforcement
- **Rationale**:
  - PRD explicitly forbids concurrent processing
  - Simple timeout implementation
  - Fail-fast on budget exhaustion
- **Alternatives considered**:
  - Async processing (rejected - PRD constraint)
  - Complex timeout management (rejected - simplicity)

## Implementation Approach

### LLM Pass Architecture
- **Pass 1**: Always run ambiguity detection (required)
- **Pass 2**: Conditional scope reduction (>7 features trigger)
- **Pass 3**: Conditional contradiction check (complexity >50 trigger)
- **Fallbacks**: Regex patterns and keyword scoring

### Budget Management
- **Token Budget**: 1000 tokens total across all passes
- **Time Budget**: 10 seconds maximum total processing
- **Cost Budget**: Minimal (claude-3-haiku tier)
- **Retry Budget**: Maximum 1 retry per pass

### Quality Gates
All requirements from the constitutional definition of done:
1. Single Python file with header docstring
2. Pydantic models for all I/O
3. Decision tables for business logic
4. Comprehensive test coverage
5. Static analysis compliance
6. Budget enforcement
7. Structured logging
8. Model usage as fallback only

## Risk Analysis

### Low Risk
- Technical implementation (well-defined constraints)
- Constitutional compliance (clear requirements)
- Testing approach (specific scenarios provided)

### Medium Risk
- LLM API reliability (mitigated by fallbacks)
- Performance within budget (mitigated by timeout enforcement)

### High Risk
- None identified (all requirements clearly specified)

## Next Steps

Proceed to Phase 1 design with confidence that all technical decisions are research-backed and constitutionally compliant.
