# Feature Specification: PRD Enhancer Program

**Feature Branch**: `013-prd-enhancer-program`
**Created**: 2025-09-23
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "prd-enhancer-program please read @docs/prd_enhancer.md and extract the specifications for building the single file program"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ’ Extract requirement to build single file PRD enhancement program
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ’ Identify: single Python file, PRD processing, enhancement workflow
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ’ All technical specifications clearly defined in PRD document
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ’ Primary user flow: PM/Tech Lead processes PRD file locally
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ’ Each requirement extracted from PRD acceptance criteria
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
   ’ PRD file, enhanced output, ambiguities, features, events
7. Run Review Checklist
   ’ Specification complete with clear boundaries
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ¡ Quick Guidelines
-  Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- L Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- =e Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
A product manager or technical lead has written a PRD document in markdown format that contains vague language, too many features, and unclear specifications. They need to enhance their PRD to make it more implementable by development teams. They run the PRD enhancer program locally on their markdown file and receive an enhanced version that eliminates ambiguities, reduces scope to core features, and provides clear specifications.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a PRD with 20 features and vague terms like "user-friendly" and "fast", **When** the enhancer processes it, **Then** it outputs maximum 5 core features with specific metrics replacing vague terms
2. **Given** a complex PRD with high complexity score, **When** enhanced, **Then** complexity score decreases by more than 30%
3. **Given** any PRD file, **When** processed, **Then** the "not doing" list contains at least 2x more items than the "doing" list
4. **Given** a PRD with workflows, **When** analyzed, **Then** it extracts maximum 5 domain events from the happy path
5. **Given** an enhanced PRD, **When** reviewed, **Then** it fits on 3 pages or less
6. **Given** invalid markdown file, **When** loaded, **Then** system fails fast with clear error message
7. **Given** a PRD with ambiguous requirements, **When** detected, **Then** system provides specific clarification suggestions

### Edge Cases
- What happens when PRD is less than 500 words (too simple)?
- How does system handle LLM API failures or timeouts?
- What if PRD already has 5 or fewer features?
- How does system respond to corrupted markdown files?
- What if complexity score is already below 30?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST accept a single markdown PRD file as input
- **FR-002**: System MUST detect and flag ambiguous terms like "user-friendly", "scalable", "fast"
- **FR-003**: System MUST provide specific metric suggestions to replace vague terms
- **FR-004**: System MUST reduce feature lists to maximum 5 core features when input has more than 7 features
- **FR-005**: System MUST generate a "not doing" list with at least 2x more items than the "doing" list
- **FR-006**: System MUST extract maximum 5 domain events from workflow descriptions
- **FR-007**: System MUST calculate and output a complexity score from 0-100 (lower is better)
- **FR-008**: System MUST reduce complexity scores by more than 30% for complex PRDs
- **FR-009**: System MUST generate minimal JSON schemas for data entities
- **FR-010**: System MUST ensure enhanced PRD fits within 3 pages maximum
- **FR-011**: System MUST complete processing within 10 seconds total timeout
- **FR-012**: System MUST fail fast with clear error messages for invalid inputs
- **FR-013**: System MUST work offline with regex fallbacks when LLM unavailable
- **FR-014**: System MUST process files sequentially (no concurrent processing)
- **FR-015**: System MUST operate statelessly with no memory between runs

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **PRD Document**: Input markdown file containing product requirements, features, and specifications
- **Enhanced PRD**: Output markdown file with reduced scope, clarified requirements, and specific metrics
- **Ambiguity**: Vague term identified in input with suggested specific replacement metric
- **Feature**: Individual capability or requirement that can be prioritized and scored
- **Domain Event**: Workflow step or business process event extracted from PRD descriptions
- **Complexity Score**: Numerical assessment (0-100) of PRD implementation difficulty
- **JSON Schema**: Minimal data structure definition for entities mentioned in PRD
