# Feature Specification: Brand Identity Design System Generator

**Feature Branch**: `001-i-would-like`
**Created**: 2025-09-19
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "i would like to create a python program that will read description from a markdown file and emit a design system (brand identity) based on schemas/brand_identity.json.schema"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   � Identified: Python program, markdown input, brand identity output, JSON schema validation
2. Extract key concepts from description
   � Actors: brand managers, designers, content creators, marketing teams
   � Actions: read markdown, parse brand descriptions, generate design system, validate schema
   � Data: brand descriptions, color palettes, typography, visual styles, logos
   � Constraints: must conform to brand_identity.json.schema specification
3. For each unclear aspect:
   � Markdown input should follow structured sections: Brand Overview, Visual Identity, Colors, Typography, Logo Assets, and Brand Personality
   � Program should generate placeholder URLs for logo assets when not provided, using pattern: https://placeholder.brand/{brandName}/logo-{variant}.svg
   � Color conversion using predefined mapping dictionary with fallback to closest web-safe colors for ambiguous descriptions
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   � Primary flow: brand manager provides brand description � gets complete design system JSON
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   � Each requirement testable against comprehensive schema validation
6. Identify Key Entities: Brand Description, Design System Components, Schema Validation
7. Run Review Checklist
   � WARN "Spec has uncertainties" - clarification points remain for implementation details
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning with clarifications)
```

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
A brand manager has written a comprehensive brand description in a markdown file, including details about the company's personality, visual preferences, color choices, typography needs, and overall aesthetic direction. They need to generate a complete brand identity design system that includes structured color palettes, typography specifications, logo placement guidelines, visual style definitions, layout principles, and accessibility preferences that can be used consistently across all marketing materials and platforms.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a markdown file with comprehensive brand description, **When** the program processes the file, **Then** it generates a complete brand identity JSON that validates against the schema and includes all required fields (brandName, colorPalette, typography, visualStyle)
2. **Given** a markdown file with partial brand information, **When** the program processes the file, **Then** it generates what it can from available information and clearly indicates which schema fields need additional input
3. **Given** a brand description mentioning "warm orange" and "professional blue", **When** the program processes colors, **Then** it converts these to valid hex codes and assigns appropriate usage guidelines
4. **Given** a generated brand identity JSON, **When** imported by design tools, **Then** all color values, typography settings, and visual specifications are usable for creating consistent brand materials
5. **Given** a new user needs to create a brand description, **When** they access the sample template file, **Then** they can understand the expected markdown structure and format requirements

### Edge Cases
- What happens when the markdown contains conflicting brand personality traits (e.g., both "playful" and "serious")?
- How does the system handle ambiguous color descriptions that could map to multiple hex values?
- What occurs when required schema fields cannot be determined from the markdown content?
- How are typography preferences handled when specific fonts aren't mentioned in the description?
- What happens when users deviate from the sample template structure but still provide valid brand information?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST read markdown files and extract brand-related content for design system generation
- **FR-002**: System MUST generate complete brand identity JSON that validates against schemas/brand_identity.json.schema
- **FR-003**: System MUST extract and convert color descriptions to valid hex codes with appropriate usage guidelines
- **FR-004**: System MUST identify typography preferences and generate font family specifications with web-safe fallbacks
- **FR-005**: System MUST determine visual style aesthetic and mood from brand personality descriptions
- **FR-006**: System MUST generate layout principles and design element specifications based on brand characteristics
- **FR-007**: System MUST include accessibility preferences with appropriate contrast levels and compliance standards
- **FR-008**: System MUST validate all generated output against the complete JSON schema before completion
- **FR-009**: System MUST provide clear error messages when required markdown sections are missing or malformed (Brand Overview, Colors, Typography)
- **FR-010**: System MUST handle logo asset references by accepting provided URLs or generating structured placeholder URLs when assets are not specified
- **FR-011**: System MUST convert natural language color descriptions using semantic color mapping with confidence scoring and fallback to nearest web-safe alternatives
- **FR-012**: System MUST assign brand personality scores using keyword analysis and sentiment scoring to determine formality (1-10), innovation (1-10), and warmth (1-10) values
- **FR-013**: System MUST provide a sample markdown template file demonstrating the expected structure and format for brand description input

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Brand Description**: Markdown-formatted text containing brand narrative, personality traits, visual preferences, color choices, and aesthetic direction
- **Color Palette**: Structured color system including primary, secondary, neutral, accent colors and gradients with hex codes and usage guidelines
- **Typography System**: Font families, sizing scales, weights, and styling preferences for headings and body text
- **Visual Style**: Aesthetic direction, mood characteristics, and imagery style preferences that define the brand's visual language
- **Logo Assets**: Logo variations, placement guidelines, and sizing specifications for consistent brand application
- **Design Elements**: Shapes, borders, shadows, patterns, and animation preferences that create cohesive brand expression
- **Layout Principles**: Grid systems, spacing, alignment, and hierarchy guidelines for consistent brand layouts
- **Brand Personality**: Quantified traits (formality, innovation, warmth) that influence all visual design decisions
- **Accessibility Preferences**: Contrast levels, color-blind safety, and motion reduction settings for inclusive design
- **Sample Template File**: Markdown template demonstrating expected structure with examples for each section (Brand Overview, Colors, Typography, etc.)
