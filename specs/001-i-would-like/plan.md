# Implementation Plan: Brand Identity Design System Generator

**Branch**: `001-i-would-like` | **Date**: 2025-09-19 | **Spec**: [spec.md](./spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/001-i-would-like/spec.md`

## Execution Flow (/plan command scope)
```
1. Load feature spec from Input path
   ✓ Loaded: Brand Identity Design System Generator specification
2. Fill Technical Context (scan for NEEDS CLARIFICATION)
   ✓ Detected: Python single-file program, markdown processing, JSON schema validation
   ✓ Set Structure Decision: Single project (Option 1)
3. Fill the Constitution Check section based on constitution document
   ✓ Applied: Single file Python, Pydantic integration, comprehensive documentation
4. Evaluate Constitution Check section below
   ✓ No violations - aligns with constitutional principles
   ✓ Update Progress Tracking: Initial Constitution Check PASS
5. Execute Phase 0 → research.md
   ✓ Research technical approaches for color mapping, NLP processing, schema validation
6. Execute Phase 1 → contracts, data-model.md, quickstart.md, CLAUDE.md
   ✓ Design data models, CLI contracts, and usage documentation
7. Re-evaluate Constitution Check section
   ✓ Design maintains constitutional compliance
   ✓ Update Progress Tracking: Post-Design Constitution Check PASS
8. Plan Phase 2 → Describe task generation approach (DO NOT create tasks.md)
   ✓ Defined task generation strategy for TDD implementation
9. STOP - Ready for /tasks command
```

**IMPORTANT**: The /plan command STOPS at step 7. Phases 2-4 are executed by other commands:
- Phase 2: /tasks command creates tasks.md
- Phase 3-4: Implementation execution (manual or via tools)

## Summary
Create a single-file Python program that reads brand descriptions from markdown files and generates complete brand identity design systems as JSON, validating against the brand_identity.json.schema. The program will use Pydantic for data validation, natural language processing for color/typography extraction, and comprehensive error handling with detailed documentation.

## Technical Context
**Language/Version**: Python 3.11+
**Primary Dependencies**: Pydantic for data validation, jsonschema for validation, re/pathlib for file processing
**Storage**: File-based (markdown input, JSON output)
**Testing**: pytest with docstring examples and edge case validation
**Target Platform**: Cross-platform CLI tool
**Project Type**: single - single file Python program per constitutional requirements
**Performance Goals**: Process typical brand descriptions (<10KB) in <1 second
**Constraints**: Single file, minimal dependencies, comprehensive documentation, Pydantic models
**Scale/Scope**: Individual brand descriptions, template generation, CLI interface

**User Implementation Details**: The application should use a single file python program and be well documented

## Constitution Check
*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

✅ **Single File Python Programs**: Design follows single-file architecture
✅ **Best Practice Adherence**: Will include PEP 8, type hints, error handling
✅ **Comprehensive Documentation**: Docstrings, inline comments, usage examples planned
✅ **Pydantic Integration**: Core requirement for schema validation and data models
✅ **Self-Contained Design**: Minimal dependencies, prefer standard library

**Status**: PASS - No constitutional violations identified

**Structure Decision**: Option 1 (Single project) - Constitutional requirement for single-file Python program

## Phase 0: Outline & Research

**Research Topics Identified**:
1. Color name to hex mapping strategies for natural language processing
2. Typography inference from brand personality descriptions
3. Brand personality scoring algorithms for sentiment analysis
4. JSON schema validation patterns with Pydantic
5. Markdown parsing for structured brand information extraction

**Research Execution**: Comprehensive analysis of technical approaches

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts

**Data Model Design**:
- Pydantic models matching brand_identity.json.schema structure
- Input parsing models for markdown content sections
- Color mapping and typography inference models
- Validation and error reporting models

**CLI Contract Design**:
- Input: markdown file path
- Output: validated JSON to stdout or file
- Error handling with clear user feedback
- Template generation capability

**Integration Testing**:
- End-to-end brand description processing
- Schema validation verification
- Error case handling validation

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach
*This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan*

**Task Generation Strategy**:
- Load `.specify/templates/tasks-template.md` as base
- Generate tasks from Phase 1 design docs (contracts, data model, quickstart)
- Each Pydantic model → model creation task [P]
- Each CLI function → implementation task [P]
- Each user story → integration test task
- Schema validation tasks
- Documentation completion tasks

**Ordering Strategy**:
- TDD order: Tests before implementation
- Dependency order: Models before parsers before CLI
- Mark [P] for parallel execution (independent components)

**Estimated Output**: 20-25 numbered, ordered tasks in tasks.md

**IMPORTANT**: This phase is executed by the /tasks command, NOT by /plan

## Phase 3+: Future Implementation
*These phases are beyond the scope of the /plan command*

**Phase 3**: Task execution (/tasks command creates tasks.md)
**Phase 4**: Implementation (execute tasks.md following constitutional principles)
**Phase 5**: Validation (run tests, execute quickstart.md, performance validation)

## Complexity Tracking
*No constitutional violations requiring justification*

## Progress Tracking
*This checklist is updated during execution flow*
