# Feature Specification: Constitutional Compliance Validation for Customer Journey Mapper

**Feature Branch**: `009-validate-that-the`
**Created**: 2025-09-20
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "validate that the customer_journey_mapper.py meets the updated constitution"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ’ Validation: "customer_journey_mapper.py" against "updated constitution"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ’ Actors: Constitutional compliance auditor, developer
   ’ Actions: validate, assess, verify, report
   ’ Data: constitution v1.3.5, customer_journey_mapper.py implementation
   ’ Constraints: All constitutional articles must be satisfied
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ’ Validation scope is clear: assess against constitution v1.3.5
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ’ Clear user flow: Run validation, generate compliance report
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ’ Each requirement is testable against constitutional articles
6. Identify Key Entities
   ’ Constitution articles, implementation artifacts, compliance report
7. Run Review Checklist
   ’ No clarifications needed, scope is bounded
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ¡ Quick Guidelines
-  Focus on WHAT compliance validation is needed and WHY
- L Avoid HOW to implement validation (no specific tools or code structure)
- =e Written for business stakeholders and quality assurance teams

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a quality assurance engineer, I need to validate that the customer_journey_mapper.py implementation fully complies with the updated constitution (v1.3.5) so that I can certify it meets all established quality, safety, and architectural standards before production deployment.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** the customer_journey_mapper.py implementation and constitution v1.3.5, **When** I run constitutional compliance validation, **Then** I receive a comprehensive report showing compliance status for all 17 constitutional articles
2. **Given** the validation report shows non-compliance issues, **When** I review the findings, **Then** I can identify specific constitutional violations with clear remediation guidance
3. **Given** the implementation fully complies with the constitution, **When** validation completes, **Then** I receive a compliance certificate suitable for audit trails

### Edge Cases
- What happens when validation tools are not available or misconfigured?
- How does the system handle partial implementation or missing artifacts?
- What occurs when constitutional requirements conflict or are ambiguous?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST validate compliance against all 17 constitutional articles (I-XVII)
- **FR-002**: System MUST check defensive programming requirements from Article VII
- **FR-003**: System MUST verify static analysis tool compliance from Article XVII
- **FR-004**: System MUST assess testing requirements from Article VIII
- **FR-005**: System MUST validate Agent Envelope output format from Article II
- **FR-006**: System MUST verify type safety compliance from Article VII
- **FR-007**: System MUST check observability logging from Article IX
- **FR-008**: System MUST validate decision table implementation from Article III
- **FR-009**: System MUST verify performance budget compliance from Article XII
- **FR-010**: System MUST assess single-file architecture from Article I
- **FR-011**: System MUST generate detailed compliance report with pass/fail status
- **FR-012**: System MUST provide remediation guidance for any violations found
- **FR-013**: System MUST validate code quality gates and control flow completeness
- **FR-014**: System MUST verify documentation and numbered flow from Article VI
- **FR-015**: System MUST check hierarchical configuration from Article V

### Key Entities
- **Constitutional Article**: Represents each of the 17 articles with specific requirements and validation criteria
- **Compliance Assessment**: Evaluation result for each article showing pass/fail status and detailed findings
- **Validation Report**: Comprehensive document containing all assessment results, violations, and remediation guidance
- **Implementation Artifact**: Code files, documentation, tests, and configuration that must comply with constitutional requirements
