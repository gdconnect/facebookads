# Feature Specification: Developer Configuration Management

**Feature Branch**: `003-please-make-it`
**Created**: 2025-09-19
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "please make it easy to edit the configuration for me model e.g base url, model, provider at the top of the file, to give developers easy way to edit, also define output folder in config, and any other thing that developers should be able to tweak"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ’ Identified: developer configuration needs, model settings, base URL, provider options, output folder, developer customization
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ’ Actors: developers, system administrators, users modifying configuration
   ’ Actions: edit configuration, modify LLM settings, change output paths, customize behavior
   ’ Data: configuration values, LLM provider settings, file paths, developer preferences
   ’ Constraints: maintain compatibility, preserve existing functionality, enable easy customization
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ’ Configuration should be centralized at top of file for easy developer access
   ’ Output folder configuration should be flexible for different deployment environments
   ’ Other tweakable settings should include timeouts, caching, and enhancement defaults
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ’ Primary flow: developer opens file ’ modifies configuration section ’ saves ’ runs tool with new settings
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ’ Each requirement focused on developer experience and configuration management
6. Identify Key Entities: Configuration Section, LLM Provider Settings, Output Management, Developer Customization Options
7. Run Review Checklist
   ’ All aspects clearly defined for business stakeholders and development teams
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ¡ Quick Guidelines
-  Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- L Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- =e Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
A developer wants to customize the LLM-Enhanced Brand Identity Processing Tool for their specific environment and requirements. They need to easily modify LLM provider settings (API endpoints, models, authentication), configure output directories for generated files, adjust performance parameters (timeouts, caching), and set default enhancement behaviors without having to hunt through the entire codebase. The configuration should be prominently located and well-documented to enable quick customization during development, testing, and deployment phases.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a developer opens the brand identity generator file, **When** they look at the top of the file, **Then** they should find a clearly marked configuration section with all customizable settings
2. **Given** a developer wants to switch from OpenAI to Anthropic, **When** they modify the provider configuration, **Then** the system should use the new provider without requiring code changes elsewhere
3. **Given** a developer wants to change the default output directory, **When** they update the output folder configuration, **Then** all generated files should be saved to the new location
4. **Given** a developer wants to customize timeout values for their slow network, **When** they modify the timeout settings, **Then** the LLM requests should wait for the specified duration before timing out
5. **Given** a developer wants to disable caching during development, **When** they toggle the caching configuration, **Then** the system should always make fresh LLM requests without using cached responses
6. **Given** a developer wants to set custom default enhancement levels, **When** they modify the enhancement configuration, **Then** new enhancement requests should use the configured defaults

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a developer sets an invalid LLM provider in the configuration?
- How does the system handle when a configured output directory doesn't exist or isn't writable?
- What occurs when timeout values are set too low for reliable LLM communication?
- How does the system behave when API base URLs are malformed or unreachable?
- What happens when configuration values conflict with command-line arguments?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST provide a centralized configuration section at the top of the main file that contains all developer-customizable settings
- **FR-002**: System MUST allow developers to easily configure LLM provider settings including provider name, API base URL, model name, and authentication method
- **FR-003**: System MUST enable developers to specify default output directories for generated JSON files, session files, and cached data
- **FR-004**: System MUST provide configurable timeout values for LLM API calls to accommodate different network conditions and provider response times
- **FR-005**: System MUST allow developers to enable or disable caching functionality through configuration settings
- **FR-006**: System MUST provide configurable default enhancement levels (minimal, moderate, comprehensive) that can be overridden by command-line arguments
- **FR-007**: System MUST include clear documentation within the configuration section explaining each setting's purpose and acceptable values
- **FR-008**: System MUST validate configuration values at startup and provide meaningful error messages for invalid settings
- **FR-009**: System MUST maintain backward compatibility so existing command-line usage continues to work without modification
- **FR-010**: System MUST allow configuration of maximum retry attempts and backoff strategies for failed LLM requests
- **FR-011**: System MUST enable developers to configure debug and logging levels for development and troubleshooting
- **FR-012**: System MUST provide configuration options for customizing enhancement prompt templates and scoring thresholds

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Configuration Section**: Centralized location at top of file containing all developer-customizable settings with clear documentation and validation
- **LLM Provider Settings**: Collection of settings for API communication including provider, base URL, model, authentication, and timeout parameters
- **Output Management Settings**: Configuration for file system paths including output directories, session storage locations, and cache file locations
- **Enhancement Behavior Settings**: Configurable defaults for enhancement levels, scoring thresholds, prompt templates, and processing preferences
- **Runtime Settings**: Configuration for debugging, logging, error handling, retry behavior, and performance optimization parameters
- **Validation Rules**: System for checking configuration validity at startup with meaningful error reporting for invalid values
