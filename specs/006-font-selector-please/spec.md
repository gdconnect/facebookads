# Feature Specification: Google Font Selector Enhancement

**Feature Branch**: `006-font-selector-please`
**Created**: 2025-09-20
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "font-selector please refactor the program to be able to choose the most appropriate google font and best settings for it to go for the brand if not explictly given a font spec in the markdown"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ’ If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ’ Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ’ Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ’ If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ’ Each requirement must be testable
   ’ Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ’ If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ’ If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ¡ Quick Guidelines
-  Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- L Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- =e Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a brand identity creator, when I provide a brand description without explicitly specifying typography details, I want the system to automatically select the most appropriate Google Font and optimal typography settings that align with my brand's personality and target audience, so that I can have a complete, professional brand identity without needing typography expertise.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a brand markdown file with color and personality information but no font specification, **When** the user runs the brand identity generator with enhancement, **Then** the system automatically selects an appropriate Google Font with proper weight, size, and usage guidelines based on the brand characteristics.

2. **Given** a brand description indicating "professional, corporate" personality, **When** the font selector analyzes the brand, **Then** it recommends serif or clean sans-serif fonts with conservative styling and formal typography hierarchy.

3. **Given** a brand description indicating "creative, playful" personality, **When** the font selector processes the request, **Then** it suggests display or modern sans-serif fonts with dynamic styling and flexible typography guidelines.

4. **Given** a brand markdown file that already specifies font preferences, **When** the user runs the enhancement, **Then** the system respects the existing font specification and does not override it with automatic selection.

5. **Given** a minimal brand description with only basic information, **When** the font selector runs, **Then** it provides sensible default font recommendations with explanation of the selection rationale.

### Edge Cases
- What happens when the brand personality is ambiguous or contradictory?
- How does the system handle brands targeting multiple demographics with different typography preferences?
- What occurs when Google Fonts service is unavailable or fonts cannot be verified?
- How does the system behave when brand descriptions are in languages that might influence font selection?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST automatically analyze brand personality, target audience, and visual characteristics to determine appropriate typography style when no font specification is provided in the brand markdown
- **FR-002**: System MUST select fonts exclusively from the Google Fonts library to ensure accessibility and web compatibility
- **FR-003**: System MUST provide font recommendations with specific weight, style, and usage guidelines (headings, body text, accents) appropriate for the brand
- **FR-004**: System MUST preserve any existing font specifications in the brand markdown and only suggest fonts when typography is missing or incomplete
- **FR-005**: System MUST include rationale and confidence scoring for font selection decisions to help users understand the recommendations
- **FR-006**: System MUST support different enhancement levels for font selection - minimal (basic font), moderate (font + weights), comprehensive (complete typography system)
- **FR-007**: System MUST ensure selected fonts have good readability characteristics and accessibility compliance for web and print usage
- **FR-008**: System MUST provide font pairing recommendations when multiple font families are needed (e.g., heading + body font combinations)
- **FR-009**: Users MUST be able to review and approve font selections in interactive mode before final inclusion in brand identity
- **FR-010**: System MUST cache font metadata and selection logic to improve performance for similar brand requests
- **FR-011**: System MUST handle font selection failures gracefully and provide fallback recommendations when primary choices are unavailable
- **FR-012**: System MUST integrate font selection with existing LLM enhancement workflow and maintain consistency with other brand elements (colors, personality, etc.)

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Brand Typography Profile**: Represents the typography characteristics needed for a brand, including font family, weights, sizes, line heights, and usage guidelines for different text elements
- **Google Font Metadata**: Represents information about available Google Fonts including font classification (serif, sans-serif, display, etc.), weight options, character support, and style characteristics
- **Font Selection Criteria**: Represents the decision factors used to match fonts to brands, including brand personality mapping, target audience preferences, and visual harmony with existing brand elements
- **Typography Recommendation**: Represents the complete font selection output including primary font choice, alternative options, usage guidelines, and selection rationale with confidence scoring
